  "Addendum": "This issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Advisory 960715. This update sets the kill bit for the vulnerable ActiveX control. Developers and web site administrators should install and use the BlackBerry Application Web Loader 1.1 component. Note that installing this package will not register the new ActiveX control on the system automatically. The 1.1 version of the ActiveX control has a different CLSID than the vulnerable version of the control, so it is unaffected by the kill bit that was deployed as part of Microsoft Security Advisory 960715. Please see the BlackBerry Technical Solution KB16248 for more details.",
