  "Description": "Because of a failure in the internal access controls, there exist\na vulnerability in all gopher servers. This enables the reading of\nfiles ABOVE the gopher-data directory, e. g. the password file, if\nthe gopherd doesn't run chroot.\n\nThe vulnerability affects only servers that are started with the\noption \"-c\". Without this option the gopherd runs chroot and\naccess to files above the gopher-data directory is disabled by\nthe operating system.",
