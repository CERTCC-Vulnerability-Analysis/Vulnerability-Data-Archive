However, without the Snort preprocessor, the Snort sensor will not detect or prevent Back Orifice traffic. Snort suggests the following steps to disable the Back Orifice preprocessor: The Back Orifice preprocessor can be disabled by commenting out the line \"preprocessor bo\" in snort.conf. This can be done in any text editor using the following procedure: 1. Locate the line \"preprocessor bo\"\n2. Comment out this line by preceding it with a hash (#). The new line will look like \"#preprocessor bo\"\n3. Save the file\n4. Restart snort",
