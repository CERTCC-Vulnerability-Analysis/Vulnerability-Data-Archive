  "Workarounds": "Until the update can be applied, consider the following workarounds: Disable VML support Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-050 suggests the following technique to disable VML support: Click Start, click Run, type \"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\regsvr32.exe\" -u \"%CommonProgramFiles%\\Microsoft Shared\\VGX\\vgx.dll\", and then click OK. A dialog box appears to confirm that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click OK to close the dialog box. Disable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document.\u00a0 Do not follow unsolicited links In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. Disable Active Scripting Although this vulnerability does not require Active Scripting to be enabled, known exploits targeting this issue use Active Scripting to place malicious code on a vulnerable system. To block this attack vector, it is recommended that Active Scripting be disabled. For instructions on how to disable Active Scripting in Microsoft Internet Explorer, please refer to the Internet Explorer section of the Securing Your Web Browser document.",
