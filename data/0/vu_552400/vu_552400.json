  "Overview": "FreeS/WAN based IKE applications do not properly validate certificate chain Self signed certificates (Issuer and Subject have the same identical Distinguished Name) are typically used to represent a Root certificate issued by a Certification Authority (CA). A Self signed certificate that is not the CA lacks the 'flow of trust' that is typically part of the public key infrastructure.",
