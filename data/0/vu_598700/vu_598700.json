  "Description": "According to Dell KACE's knowledge base article: \"The Dell KACE K2000 Systems Deployment Appliance version 3.3.36822 and earlier uses a read-only CIFS fileshare named \"peinst\" to facilitate Windows deployments. This hidden, read-only fileshare is populated with pre- and post-installation tasks as well as deployment bootfiles and media used for Windows network operating system installs (called \"Scripted Installs\") and imaging (called \"K-images\"). This fileshare is hidden. It provides anonymous read-only access because of limitations with Windows PE 2005 and earlier in accessing a password-protected share as a root drive.\"", 
  "CVSS_AccessComplexity": "", 
  "CVSS_SecurityRequirementsAR": "", 
  "Resolution": "Dell KACE has plans to provide authentication for these fileshares in a future release, as earlier versions of Windows PE are phased out of its user base.",

The rights of accounts used in unattend.xml, sysprep.inf and any post-install script be assigned using the principle of least privilege. For example, accounts used to add a computer to a domain only have that right, restricted by container, and no other.",
