  "Description": "CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions - CVE-2015-6034 EPSON Network Utility v4.10 is an application that checks the printer status and displays the printing progress over the network. During installation, the EPSON Network Utility creates EpsonBidirectionalService which runs as SYSTEM. The corresponding executable, eEBSVC.exe, has insecure permissions, allowing full access to the \"Everyone\" group in Windows. By replacing eEBSVC.exe with a malicious file of the same name, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.",
