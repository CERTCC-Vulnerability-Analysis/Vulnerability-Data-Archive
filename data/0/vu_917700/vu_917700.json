  "Description": "It has been reported that Huawei Echo Life HG8247 optical routers running software version V1R006C00S120 or earlier contain a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker can perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against an authenticated user through the web interface by creating a malicious entry in the \"failed log-in attempts over telnet\" log view. When logging on to the device using telnet, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML/Javascript code as a username. It also has been reported that Huawei Echo Life HG8240 and Huawei Echo Life HG8245 routers could also be affected as they share the same service manual.",
