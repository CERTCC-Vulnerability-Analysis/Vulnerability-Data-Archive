  "Description": "Windows NT utilizes the Server Message Block/Common Internet\nFilesystem (SMB/CIFS) protocol for network file sharing and other\ncommunications.  To access the SMB/CIFS service on a Windows NT\nsystem, a logon request is initiated.  Due to incorrect processing of\nthe SMB logon packet, memory corruption occurs within the Windows\nNT kernel.\n\nAn SMB logon packet contains the following data:\n\n- Username\n- Password\n- Operating system\n- Lan Manager type\n- Domain\n\nThe SMB logon request contains the size of data which follows.\nWhen the size of data which is specified in the request does not\ncorrespond to the size of data which is actually present,\ncorruption occurs.  As a result of corruption, a \"Blue Screen\"\noccurs, and the system reboots, and in some instances hangs on this\nscreen.\n\nThis attack can be launched without a valid login and password, since\ncorruption occurs during processing of the logon request.",
