  "Description": "From the BugTraq Posting\n\nI've found a local->root compromise in the lprm program, as shipped\nRedHat4.2 and RedHat5.0. Other systems untested.\n\nThere is a prerequisite to exploiting this, that a remote printer be\ndefined (rm field).\n\nIf trying to remove entries from a remote queue, the args given are\nbasically strcat()'ed into a static buffer.\n\nThus:\n\nlprm -Psome_remote `perl -e 'print \"a\" x 2000'`\nSegmentation fault\n\ngdb confirms the program is attempting to execute code at 0x41414141\n\nOther potential problems include assumptions about host name max lengths,\ndubious /etc/printcap parsing (but it seems user defined printcap files\nare not allowed). There is also a blatant strcpy(buf, getenv(\"something\"))\nbut luckily it is #ifdef'ed out. File/filename handling looks iffy at\ntimes too.\n\nIt is scary that this was found in a mere 5 mins of auditing. I sincerely\nbeleieve the BSD line printer system has no place on a secure system. When\nI get more time I might well look for other problems; I would not be\nsurprised to find some. The lpr package is in need of an audit. If the\ngreat folks at OpenBSD have already done this, maybe others should nab\ntheir source code :-)",
