  "Impact": "An attacker who is able to capture an encrypted SSL/TLS session and query the server while it is using the same private RSA key that was used for the captured session could decrypt the captured session. An attacker could also forge a signature that appeared to be from the server (section 3.4).",

In order to defeat this specific attack, an SSL/TLS server must not respond distinctively when a premaster secret sent by the client contains an incorrect or unexpected SSL/TLS version number. The paper recommends that an SSL/TLS server always replace the client-provided version number with the expected version number as determined from either the Client hello or Server hello messages (section 6.2).",

In the case of an attack against SSL/TLS web servers, logs may show a relatively high number of network connections and failed attempts to establish SSL/TLS sessions. Depending on baseline performance, servers may show increased CPU usage or an above average number of network connections.",
