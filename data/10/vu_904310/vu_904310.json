Sites are strongly encouraged to upgrade to a software version that eliminates the vulnerability. Although there is no reliable workaround, Cisco recommends the following mitigation step until patches can be applied: As a possible mitigation, users deploying the VPNSM for site-to-site connectivity could apply ACLs on the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch or the Cisco 7600 Series Internet Router to limit the IP addresses that can establish IPSec sessions with the VPNSM.",
