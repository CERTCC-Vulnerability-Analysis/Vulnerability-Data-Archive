  "Description": "In my method JavaScript would have to be used to automatically\nsubmit a HTML Form to the server.  In these forms a page writer\ncould have already coded the file name into the source document,\nsuch as \"autoexec.bat\".  When the browser loads the page off of the\nserver, it submits the form which transmits the file to the server\nvia the HTTP-File upload procedure.  The SERVER now has the file\nthe author wanted.  To fool the user, the CGI program sends the\nlocation of the real web page to the client, and the client doesn't\nknow otherwise.\n\nThis method would require the files to be small or else the user\nwill notice this is taking a long time to load the page over a\nmodem.  But the potential for this exploit to be used over faster\ntransmission lines is greater.  To have a solution to this problem\nwould be a warning dialog box, telling the user that they are\ntransmitting a file not just a regular HTTP form.  I have not\nwritten a single line of code exploiting this potential\nvulnerability, I might get around to it if I have time.  Please\nnote: I sent this original message 1 day (June 12) before to\nNetscape and now they confirm that my hypothesis was correct on the\nURL: http://home.netscape.com/misc/security_update.html",
