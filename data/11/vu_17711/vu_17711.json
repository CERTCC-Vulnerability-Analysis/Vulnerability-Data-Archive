  "Description": "A new program was released this weekend that allows ANYONE with remote\naccess to an NT server (using ports 137, 138, and 139) to connect to\nthat machine, read the registry, and create a new share accessible to\nthe Everyone group. This is a SERIOUS problem that should be guarded\nagainst at all costs. A quick test of this new RedButton program shows\nthat it does in fact connect to a remote NT system.",
