  "Description": "no operations authority code added to  FTP 2.2.1\nwas buggy.\nUser X attempts to logon to FTP on MVS but has some kind of\nproblem (eg. their password has expired). User X eventually\ngets logged on and then does some file transfers. User X then\nexits FTP on MVS.\nUser Y later logs on to FTP on MVS and then does some file\ntransfers. ACF2 reports datasets violations for user Y's\ndatasets by user X. This of course does not make any sense\nsince user X has long ago quit FTP. User Y does not see or\nhave any problems while using FTP on MVS.",
