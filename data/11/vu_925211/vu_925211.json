  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker with minimal knowledge of the vulnerable system and the ability to conduct a brute force attack against an affected application may be able to guess secret key material. Secondary impacts include authenticated access to the system through the affected service or the ability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.",

  "Resolution": "Apply a patch from the vendor and regenerate key material Patches have been release by the affected vendors. Users are encouraged to review the Systems Affected section of this document and apply the updates it refers to. Due to the nature of the flaw, any key material generated by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL package should be considered fatally defective. Additionally, all DSA keys ever used on affected Debian systems for signing or authentication purposes should be considered compromised since the Digital Signature Algorithm relies on a secret random value used during signature generation. After the software updates are applied, this key material must be regenerated with the updated version of the software. Vendor-specific instructions for doing this can also be found in the Systems Affected section of this document.",
