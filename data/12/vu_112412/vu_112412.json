  "Description": "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CVE-2014-2947\nAccording to Open-Sec consultant Mauricio Urizar, all versions of Bizagi BPM Suite contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize the txtUsername POST parameter to the Login.aspx page. CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CVE-2014-2948\nFurthermore, Urizar reports that all versions of Bizagi BPM Suite are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through the workflowenginesoa.asmx web service. By sending specially crafted SOAP requests to the web service, a remote authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements. The CVSS score reflects CVE-2014-2948.",
