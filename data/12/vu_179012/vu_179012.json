Note that this may reduce the functionality of sites that utilize FPSE extensions. Disable Internet Information Server The IIS web server is installed by default on several versions of Microsoft Windows. As a general rule, the CERT/CC recommends that system administrators disable or remove any nonessential software. In this case, IIS should be removed from any host that is not expected to serve web pages.",
