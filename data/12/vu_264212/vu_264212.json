  "Impact": "The DNS server process is subjected to a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack, the exact nature of the denial of service varies depending on the implementation. Some DNS implementations attempt to follow all delegations at once, which results in a large burst of network traffic. Other implementations may result in denial of service against the DNS server itself due to repeated query results from a malicious authoritative DNS server. The effect can range from increased server response time to clients to complete interruption of the service.",

  "Description": "The Domain Name System (DNS) allows decentralized publishing of data such as IP addresses associated with domains. Due to the decentralized nature, domain administrators may delegate the task of providing data to a third-party DNS server. RFC 1034 describes the standard technical issues of enabling domain delegations, but does not provide a specific implementation, leaving DNS servers to provide their own methods to implement RFC 1034. In some implementations of this delegation mechanism, a specially crafted query from an attack may cause the DNS server to follow an infinite chain of delegations and re-delegations. The infinite chain creates a denial of service (DoS) situation on the DNS server. This issue primarily affects DNS resolvers, but a similar issue may also affect DNS authoritative servers. Please see the Internet Systems Consortium's report for more information.", 
  "CVSS_AccessComplexity": "L", 
  "CVSS_SecurityRequirementsAR": "ND", 
  "Resolution": "Apply an update The issue is resolved by limiting the number of delegations in the resolving process. Many DNS vendors are providing updates to the software mitigate the attack by allowing the user to adjust the number of delegations allowed before alerting the user that the request was unsuccessful. Please update your DNS server software to the latest release as the updates become available.",
