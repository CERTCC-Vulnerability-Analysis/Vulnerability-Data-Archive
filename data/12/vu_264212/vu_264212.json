  "Impact": "A recursive DNS resolver following an infinite chain of referrals can result in high process memory and CPU usage and eventually process termination. The effect can range from increased server response time to clients to complete interruption of the service. Resolvers that follow multiple referrals at once can cause large bursts of network traffic.",

  "Description": "RFC 1034 describes the standard technical issues of enabling domain delegations in DNS, but does not provide a specific implementation, leaving DNS servers to provide their own methods to implement RFC 1034. In some implementations of recursive resolvers, a query to a malicious authoritative server may cause the resolver to follow an infinite chain of referrals. Attempting to follow the infinite chain can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) situation on the DNS resolver due to resource exhaustion. This issue primarily affects recursive resolvers. Additionally, as noted in ISC Security Advisory AA-01216: \"Authoritative servers can be affected if an attacker can control a delegation traversed by the authoritative server in servicing the zone.\" Depending on how the resolver handles out-of-bailiwick glue records and performs simultaneous queries, it may also be possible to cause the resolver to perform a DoS attack on a target using DNS traffic.", 
  "CVSS_AccessComplexity": "M", 
  "CVSS_SecurityRequirementsAR": "ND", 
  "Resolution": "Apply an update These issues are addressed by limiting the maximum number of referrals followed and the number of simultaneous queries. See the Vendor Information section below for information about specific vendors.",
