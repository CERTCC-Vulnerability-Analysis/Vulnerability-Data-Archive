  "Impact": "By convincing a victim to click on a link in an HTML document (web page, HTML email), an attacker could issue any command or change any configuration that can be set via UPnP on an affected device. If the affected device is providing routing or firewalling services to clients, an attacker may be able to change firewall and port forwarding rules, modify DNS settings, change wireless encryption keys, or set arbitrary administration passwords.",

  "Workarounds": "Adobe has issued an update that prevents Flash from being used as an attack vector to exploit this vulnerability. From the Understanding Flash Player 9 April 2008 Security Update compatibility document: The April 2008 Flash Player update adds a new security feature to perform a cross-domain policy file check before allowing SWFs to send headers to another domain. This change helps improve web site security by helping to defend against malicious HTTP headers sent by content from other domains. The feature will also help to mitigate a potential UPnP issue (VU#347812) in which routers fail to correctly handle unexpected header values. Workarounds for administrators\nUPnP should be disabled on devices that are being use to enforce security policies or are connected to untrusted networks, such as the Internet. Filtering the IGMP protocol between LAN segments may prevent UPnP devices from connecting to networks that they are not authorized to access. Workarounds for users\nDisabling UPnP on network devices will mitigate this vulnerability. Note that disabling UPnP will cause any devices or applications that rely on UPnP to fail or operate with reduced functionality. Disabling UPnP in desktop operating systems may prevent an attacker from exploiting this vulnerability. Microsoft Windows XP users should see the workarounds section of Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-019 for instructions on how to disable UPnP. Using the Mozilla Firefox NoScript extension to whitelist web sites that can run scripts and access installed plugins may prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. Using host-based firewalls to filter ports 1900/udp and 2869/tcp both inbound and outbound may prevent this vulnerability from being exploited by blocking the ports that UPnP uses. Note that the Windows Vista firewall blocks UPnP by default. This workaround may not be able to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.",
