  "Workarounds": "Make the configure script not executable Removing, renaming or marking the TWiki configure script (twiki/bin/configure) as not executable will prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. Restrict access Restricting access by using a web application or string-matching firewall to block URLs  that contain the string /bin/configure may partially mitigate this vulnerability. An example of a string matching rule using iptables is: iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m string --string '/bin/configure' --algo bm -j DROP This workaround is unlikely to be effective in many cases, such as when the server uses the https protocol. This firewall rule should be tested before using on a production system.",
