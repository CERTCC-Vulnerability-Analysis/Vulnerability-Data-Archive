  "Resolution": "Disable Gopher support\nUnless a specific need is known for Gopher support in your web browser or operating system, either disable support in the application or remove the Gopher application(s) from the system. This will help to mitigate future attacks should the Gopher code in question not be updated in a timely fashion. Only connect to trusted hosts\nAs a best practice, do not connect to Gopher hosts or follow web links you are unfamiliar with. This may not mitigate the vulnerability exposure completely as it is not possible to be certain a server has not been compromised. Apply an update\nContact your vendor for updates, fixes, and workarounds.",
