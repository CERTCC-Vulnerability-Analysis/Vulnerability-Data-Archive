  "Description": "Samba is a widely used open-source implementation of Server Message Block (SMB)/Common Internet File System (CIFS). The sid_parse()function (and related dom_sid_parse()function in the source4 code) do not correctly check their input lengths when reading a binary representation of a SID. A connection to a file share is needed to exploit this vulnerability, either authenticated or unauthenticated (guest connection). This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send a Windows SID (Security ID) that can overflow the stack variable that is being used to store the SID in the Samba smbd server.",

  "Resolution": "Apply a patch or upgrade These vulnerabilities are addressed in Samba version 3.5.5. In addition, patches are available to address this vulnerability in all current Samba releases. Consult Samba Security Guidelines Refer to the Samba Security Releases website for more information. Restrict Access to Samba As a general security best practice, restrict access to Samba services to hosts and networks that require those services. Consider blocking Samba traffic at network borders.",
