  "Description": "According to CA's website: \"CA SiteMinder provides a centralized security management foundation that enables the secure use of the web to deliver applications and cloud services to customers, partners, and employees.\" CA Siteminder software fails to sanitize POST requests sent to the login.fcc form. As a result, stored and reflective cross site scripting (XSS) attacks can be conducted. An attacker can inject javascript code that will be run each time the specified webpage is accessed by inserting javascript code in the affected parameter. According to the reporter the login.fcc webpage and postpreservationdata parameter is affected by a reflective XSS vulnerability, postpreservationdata=fail&target=\"><script>alert(1)</script><\"",
