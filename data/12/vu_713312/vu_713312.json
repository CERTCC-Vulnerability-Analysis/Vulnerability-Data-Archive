  "Description": "CWE-200: Information Exposure - CVE-2016-1562 The DTE Energy Insight app lets DTE Energy customers track their energy usage. This information is exposed via an HTTP REST API. The API contains a parameter 'filter' that may be manipulated by an authenticated user. This parameter determines the customer data to be returned by the server. By manipulating the 'filter' parameter, an authorized user may be able to obtain and query limited customer information for other users. The researcher has released a blog post with more details.",
