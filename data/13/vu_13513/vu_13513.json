  "Workarounds": "Suggested workaround include: 1. Always start X with: \"startx &; vlock\". This will lock the virtual terminal while X is running. This requires an awareness of the vulnerability. You might be able to put the vlock at the end of the startx script. 2. Run XDM. While this doesn't really correct the vulnerability, it will make it less likely that users will leave a virtual terminal unlocked accidentally. 3. Disable virtual terminals.",
