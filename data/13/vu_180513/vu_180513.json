  "Description": "Microsoft Windows comes with an ActiveX component called \"ActiveX control for streaming video,\" which is provided by msvidctl.dll. This component provides a number of Class Identifiers (CLSIDs) that are marked as Safe for Scripting and Safe for Initialization, which means that they can be used by Internet Explorer. The ActiveX controls provided by msvidctl.dll fail to properly handle file input, which can result in stack memory corruption. This can allow the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) to be overwritten, thus allowing subversion of the program execution flow.",
