  "Description": "The Apache HTTP server running on Windows platforms contains a flaw in mod_isapi which could enable an attacker to unload ISAPI.dll before request processing is complete. An attacker can send a specially-crafted request and RESET packet to the server, resulting in ISAPI.dll being unloaded. Additional requests can result in memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Apache httpd versions 2.2.14, 2.2.13, 2.2.12, 2.2.11, 2.2.10, 2.2.9, 2.2.8, 2.2.6, 2.2.5, 2.2.4, 2.2.3, 2.2.2, 2.2.0, 2.0.63, 2.0.61, 2.0.59, 2.0.58, 2.0.55, 2.0.54, 2.0.53, 2.0.52, 2.0.51, 2.0.50, 2.0.49, 2.0.48, 2.0.47, 2.0.46, 2.0.45, 2.0.44, 2.0.43, 2.0.42, 2.0.40, 2.0.39, and 2.0.37.",
