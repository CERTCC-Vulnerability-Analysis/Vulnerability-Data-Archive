  "Description": "The man utility will format manual pages for you and display them on\nyour terminal.  Some of these manual pages are stored in compressed\nformat to save disk space.  These man pages are uncompressed with\ngzip before they are displayed on your terminal.  The gzip utility\ncreates a temporary file in /tmp with a predicable file name (e.g.\n\"man<pid>\") and often with mode 666.  An attacker could use a perl\nscript to create symbolic links to a root owned file in /tmp for\na range of pids and wait for root to run man.",
