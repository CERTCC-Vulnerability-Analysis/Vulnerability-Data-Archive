  "Workarounds": "Cryptographically authenticate 802.11 management frames As noted in the paper referenced above:  \"The deauthentication [and deassociation and power saving] vulnerability can be solved directly by explicitly authenticating management frames and dropping invalid requests.\" requires hardware capable of doing crypto quickly, ie new hardware work underway, cite MS doc or IEEE or other Check for traffic after de-authentication or de-association Another potential solution would not require significant hardware replacement. Citing the paper again: In particular, by delaying the effects of deauthentication or disassociation requests (e.g., by queuing such requests for 5-10 seconds) an AP has the opportunity to observe subsequent packets from the client. If a data packet arrives after a deauthentication or disassociation request is queued, that request is discarded since a legitimate client would never generate packets in that order. This solution would require firmware upgrades and most likely a change to the 802.11 standard. In addition, this solution creates a new timing vulnerablity when a node changes associations between access points.",
