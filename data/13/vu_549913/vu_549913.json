  "Impact": "An intruder can exploit this vulnerability to make an unsigned plug-in appear to be certified by Adobe for use in Acrobat Reader: Any user induced to install a malicious plug-in with a forged digital signature into an Acrobat viewer plug_ins directory will have no way to differentiate it from other legitimately certified plug-ins (for example, by using Help->About Adobe Acrobat Plug-ins...in Acrobat Reader 5.1 for Windows). Any Acrobat plug-in designed to only load in certified mode in Adobe Acrobat Reader may execute in an untrustworthy computer environment, leading to other malicious behavior. Any PDF document created to only be loaded in Acrobat Reader certified mode may open in an untrustworthy user environment, leading to other malicious behavior.",

This digital signature mechanism is not cryptographically strong and allows other potentially-malicious plug-in code to pretend to be certified by Adobe and be executed by Acrobat Reader even when in 'Certified Plug-ins Only' mode.",
