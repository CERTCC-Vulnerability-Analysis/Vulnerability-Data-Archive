  "Impact": "As a precondition, this vulnerability requires the ability to modify the SQL service account registry key (for example, via the \"xp_regwrite\" extended stored procedure). Attackers must convince an administrator to grant this access, or they must obtain it by exploiting a second vulnerability. This vulnerability allows attackers to weaken the security policy of the SQL Server by elevating its privileges and causing it to run in the LocalSystem security context. As a side effect, it increases the severity of vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain the privileges of the SQL service account. In some cases, this may enable attackers to compromise the server host as well.",
