  "VendorStatement": "SUSE Linux products include bind, powerdns-recursor and dnsmasq\nas name servers. An update for bind is available as online update since 2008-07-10\nand we posted the SUSE-SA:2008:033 advisory to: http://www.novell.com/linux/security/advisories/2008_33_bind.html The last powerdns-recursor security update from May also added\nrandom UDP source-ports which should make it not vulnerable to the\nnew attack Dan Kaminsky found. The DNS forwarder dnsmasq does not emit recursive queries and\nis therefore not vulnerable as far as we know. Additionally\ndnsmasq will be fixed to use a CPRNG for generating the TRXID\nand the UDP source-port.",
