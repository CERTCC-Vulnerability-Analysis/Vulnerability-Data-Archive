  "Description": "Actually several problems.\n1) Passes data under user's control to popen.  Reported in April,\n\"fixed\", but incompletely.  Reported on a missed popen in July.\n\"Fixed\" but again incompletely.  German Cert reported a missed\npopen.  Fixed, but again incompletely.  JTE found another missed\npopen.  Convinced Paul the right solution was to not use popen,\nbut he is only starting to parse tokens currently and still\nhas not gotten rid of popen.\n\n2) Mails data under the control of user.  Defaults on most sites\nto ucbmail which allows embedded commands.  Fixed by using /bin/mail.\n\n3) Does own checking for \"..\" in pathnames to mimic chroot\ncapabilities.  But did an incomplete job.  In particular,\nsometimes the filename was passed to popen after the checks\nwhich allows .'.'/.'.'/etc/passwd to be interpreted as\n../../etc/passwd which should have been disallowed.",
