  "Description": "ASUS's Wireless-N Gigabit Router RT-N56U contains a vulnerability which may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to recover the device's administrator password. An attacker with network access to the device can navigate to the web page http://RouterIPAddress/QIS_wizard.htm?flag=detect. The attacker will be presented with a web page containing the device's configuration without entering any login credentials. This web page will display the device's administrator password. The default configuration for this device is to only allow clients connected to the Local Area Network (LAN) to access the system web interface. This vulnerability has been reported in ASUS's Wireless-N Gigabit Router RT-N56U firmware version 1.0.1.4.",
