These are typically ports 42/tcp and 137/udp. Please note that this workaround does not protect vulnerable WINS servers from internal attacks. Disable vulnerable service Disable WINS until a patch can be applied. As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that are not explicitly required.",
