  "Impact": "An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of an application that uses the vulnerable function. The scope of the impact depends on how the affected application works. Applications that process filename input from the network, such as some web applications, would be vulnerable to a remote attacker. Applications that only process filename input from a local user would only be vulnerable to a local attacker.",
