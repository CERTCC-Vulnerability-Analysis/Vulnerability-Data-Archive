  "Description": "PRIMOS allows one to protect EPF files (executables)\nfor execute only access; however, a problem exists when a new copy\nof the program is created.  The EPFs are mapped to read and\nexecute segments--the program reads the segment and writes out a\nnew copy of the EPF wherever the user chooses and has access.\n\nIf EPF doesn't occupy a whole page, other data from previous\ncommands/text may be copied from the segment and appended to\nnew object code.",
