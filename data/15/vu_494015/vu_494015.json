  "Description": "CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data - CVE-2016-9482 A remote unauthenticated user may bypass authentication to access the administrator panel by navigating directly to: /admin.php?mod=admin&func=panel CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data - CVE-2016-9483 The generated PHP form code deserializes untrusted input as part of the phpfmg_filman_download() function. A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to use this vulnerability to inject PHP code, or along with CVE-2016-9484 (below) to perform local file inclusion attacks and obtain files from the server. CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') - CVE-2016-9484 The generated PHP form code does not properly validate user input folder directories, allowing a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform a path traversal and access arbitrary files on the server. The PHP FormMail Generator website does not use version numbers and is updated continuously. Any PHP form code generated by this website prior to 2016-12-06 may be vulnerable.",
