  "Description": "synchronize appears to have a tiny little vulnerability. Even when calendar entries are marked private the current day is viewable (grayed out, but readable) even before a username and password are entered. Its likely that whatever packets are sent to the \nserver are entirely spoofable, so its pretty trivial to read someone's calendar.",
