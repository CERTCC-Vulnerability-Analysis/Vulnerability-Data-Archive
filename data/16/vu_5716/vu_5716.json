  "Description": "/usr/sbin/datman, which is also invoked by running cdman, or\ndouble-clicking on cdrom icon on the desktop, is suid and buggy.\nIt can be used by any local user to obtain root privileges\n(contrary to previously published information).  Both Irix 5.3 and\n6.2 are vulnerable, if dmedia_tools.sw.cddat subsystem is\ninstalled.\n\n/usr/sbin/datman is essentially a fatter, more featured version of\ncdplayer (or cdplayer is stripped down datman, whatever).  They do\nthe same stuff in regard to cd-rom databases.  However, datman\ncalls setreuid(0, realuid) at the very beginning, so uid stays 0,\nbut euid is whatever user's uid is.  Interesting idea, it works in\nthe sense that all created files are owned by user, but it doesn't\nhelp much otherwise.\n\nFor backward compatibility reasons, upon startup datman looks for a\nfile .cdplayerrc in the home directory.  If it exists, and\ndirectory ~/.cddb doesn't exists, it will ask if you want to\nconvert .cdplayerrc to .cddb.  If you answer yes, it will invoke\n/usr/sbin/cddbcvt, giving old and new database names as arguments\nto it.  Using system().  What more can be said?",
