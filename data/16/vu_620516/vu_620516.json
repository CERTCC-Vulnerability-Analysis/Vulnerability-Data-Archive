  "Impact": "A local attacker who is able to modify the configuration of the tibhawkhma program may be able to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. TIBCO states the following: If the tibhawkhma program is installed as suid root on a Unix system, the successful exploit will allow arbitrary code execution with root privileges. If the tibhawkhma program is installed as a system service on a Windows system, the successful exploit will allow arbitrary code execution with system service privileges.",
