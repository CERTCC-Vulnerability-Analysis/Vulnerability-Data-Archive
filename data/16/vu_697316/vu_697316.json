  "Description": "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CVE-2015-0967 SearchBlox contains multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, including a reflected XSS in the default search box of http://<HOST_NAME>:8080/searchblox/plugin/index.html and a persistent XSS in the title field of the 'Create Featured Result' form, http://<HOST_NAME>:8080/searchblox/admin/main.jsp?menu1=res. Note that an attacker must be authenticated to leverage the persistent XSS. CWE-434: Unrestricted File Upload of File with Dangerous Type - CVE-2015-0968 Active content, such as JSP pages, can be uploaded to http://<HOST_NAME>:8080/searchblox/admin/uploadImage.html. This can be done by submitting the content using the form and using a client proxy to ensure that the \"Content-Type\" for the uploaded file is \"image/jpeg\". The attacker can then visit the uploaded content and enable its execution. Note that though the URL in question appears to be in an authenticated portion of the server, the page can be accessed without authentication. This issue was previously published in VU#592942 (see CVE-2013-3590) and reportedly addressed in version 7.5 build 1. SearchBlox 8.1.5 and possibly earlier versions have since been found to be vulnerable. CWE-200: Information Exposure - CVE-2015-0969 Potentially sensitive information can be viewed by unauthenticated users who directly access http://<HOST_NAME>:9200/_cluster/health?pretty=true. CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2015-0970 SearchBlox contains a global cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request.
