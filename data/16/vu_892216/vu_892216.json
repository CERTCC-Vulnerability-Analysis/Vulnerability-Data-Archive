  "Description": "The web application Sentinel HASP Admin Control Center, which is accessed remotely, does not sufficiently validate user input. This characteristic can allow attackers to craft and inject HTML code into the configuration file. The vulnerability can be reproduced using Mozilla Firefox 2.0. As of this writing (November 2011), it is not reproducible with the current versions of Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Opera, and Google Chrome.
