  "Impact": "An attacker can attempt to login to your system from a location that is not allowed. If the attacker has a private key in their possession that is allowed to access the system, they will be able to gain entry to the network. If the attacker does not have a legitimate private key, they may be able to guess a correct username/password pair if you allow password authentication.",

  "Resolution": "The OpenSSH maintainers recommend enabling VerifyReverseMapping in sshd_config. You may also wish to restrict access to the secure shell service by applying packet filters for port 22/tcp at your network perimeter. While this measure will limit your exposure to attacks, blocking port 22/tcp at a network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. In cases where applying packet filters is not feasible, software such as Wietse Venema's TCP Wrappers can be used to restrict access to the secure shell daemon. Finally, it is highly advisable to use public key authentication as opposed to password authentication. In our estimation, this vulnerability does not pose an imminent threat; however, it permits a greater-than-expected level of access to a security control in your infrastructure. The next release of OpenSSH will drop the VerifyReverseMapping option and, subsequently, sshd will by default perform reverse-mapping. At this point in time, we do not know if the OpenSSH maintainers plan to make a patch available before the next release.",
