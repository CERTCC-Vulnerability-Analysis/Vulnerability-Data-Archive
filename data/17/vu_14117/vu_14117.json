  "Impact": "From CA-1998-06: Depending on the configuration of the target machine, a remote\nintruder can gain root access to a vulnerable system or cause the NIS+\nserver to crash, which will affect the usability of any system which\ndepends on NIS+. Additionally, if your NIS+ server is running in NIS\ncompatibility mode and if an intruder is able to crash the NIS+\nserver, the intruder may be able to masquerade as an NIS server and\ngain access to machines that depend on NIS for authentication. Finally, if an intruder is able to crash an NIS+ server and\nthere are clients on the local network that are initialized by\nbroadcast, an intruder may be able to provide false initialization\ninformation to the NIS+ clients. Clients that are initialized by\nhostname may also be vulnerable under some circumstances.",
