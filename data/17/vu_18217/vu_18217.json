Some systems did, however, implement STOP 4.0.3\non an interim basis to facilitate initial testing and operations.\nDuring development and testing of STOP 4.1, a vulnerability was\ndiscovered which could, under certain conditions, result in\nuntrusted applications being granted limited addressability to CMOS\nmemory.",
