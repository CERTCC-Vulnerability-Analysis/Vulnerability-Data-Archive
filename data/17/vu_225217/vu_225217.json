  "Resolution": "Apply an update WinZip 10 users should update to Winzip 10 build 7245. This update provides a version of the FileView control that is not marked \"safe for scripting\" or \"safe for initialization,\" which means that a web page cannot trigger the buffer overflow. Versions of WinZip prior to 10 do not appear to contain the vulnerable ActiveX control. Sky Software FileView ActiveX control users should update to version 8.0 of the control. This version appears to fix the buffer overflow vulnerability.",
