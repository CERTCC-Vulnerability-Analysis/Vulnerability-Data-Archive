  "Workarounds": "Disable the Print Spooler service Disabling the Print Spooler service will mitigate this vulnerability. To disable the Print Spooler service: 1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel. Alternatively, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel. 2. Double-click Administrative Tools. 3. Double-click Services. 4. Double-click Print Spooler. 5. In the Startup type list, click Disabled. 6. Click Stop, and then click OK. Note that disabling or removing the Print Spooler service on a system will prevent that system from being able to print either locally or remotely. Block or Restrict Access The Print Spooler service is accessible via RPC. Blocking access to RPC services (135/tcp, 139/tcp, 445/tcp) from untrusted networks such as the Internet may mitigate this vulnerability.",
