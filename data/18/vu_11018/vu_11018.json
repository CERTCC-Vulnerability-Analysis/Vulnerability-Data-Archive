  "Description": "From the man page:\n\nAfter five unsuccessful login attempts, all the attempts are\nlogged in the file /var/adm/loginlog.  This file contains one\nrecord for each failed attempt.  Each record contains the\nlogin name, tty specification, and time.\n\nThis is an ASCII file.  Each field within each entry is\nseparated from the next by a colon.  Each entry is separated\nfrom the next by a new-line.\n\nBy default, loginlog does not exist, so no logging is done.\nTo enable logging, the log file must be created with read and\nwrite permission for owner only.  Owner must be root and group\nmust be sys.\n\nThe problem is that in Solaris 2.6, loginlog only logs attemots\nagainst accounts NOT in the password file.  This means that if an\nattacker is attempting to login to an account that _does_ exist,\nthen this won't be logged.",
