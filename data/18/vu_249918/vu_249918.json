  "Description": "CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File Redis Data Structure Server version 2.6.16 contains an insecure temporary file vulnerability. The rdb.c file does not use a secure temporary file creation routine. Since the function in this file is based on a PID value, this makes the function lack proper entropy and protection from race conditions. A local authenticated attacker may be able to overwrite and unlink any files or links placed in temp-PID.rdb.",
