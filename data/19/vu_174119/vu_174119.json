  "Description": "Solarwinds Network Performance Monitor 10.2.2 can be attacked by modifying the snmpd.conf file with malicious JavaScript (XSS) (CWE-79) (CVE-2012-2577). The malicious JavaScript is stored in the application and then may be leveraged to mount an CSRF (CWE-352) (CVE-2012-2602) attack against a logged on administrator.",
