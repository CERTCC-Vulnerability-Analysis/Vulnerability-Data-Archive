  "Description": "SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) is a method for adding authentication support to various protocols. SASL is commonly used by mail servers to request authentication from clients and by clients to authenticate to servers. The sasl_encode64() function converts a string into base64. The Cyrus SASL library contains buffer overflows that occur because of unsafe use of the sasl_encode64() function.",
