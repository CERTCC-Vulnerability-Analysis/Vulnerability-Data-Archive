  "Impact": "By creating symbolic links with appropriate names within a very tight time window, a local attacker may be able to redirect the data sent to the temporary file to arbitrary files on machines running tripwire. Since tripwire normally is executed by the system administrator, file protections will not apply. The file overwrite may result in disabling of system services, crashing the machine, or disabling of system protections.",

  "Overview": "Tripwire is a file integrity verification utility for Unix and Linux operating systems. In some implementations, tripwire opens insecure temporary files with predictable names in publically-writable directories. Using a symbolic link attack, a local intruder may overwrite or create arbitrary files on machines running tripwire.",
