  "Description": "SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities\nThe Cisco FWSM is affected by three vulnerabilities that may cause the device to reload during the processing of different crafted SunRPC messages when SunRPC inspection is enabled. These vulnerabilities are only triggered by transit traffic; traffic that is destined to the device does not trigger these vulnerabilities. TCP Denial of Service Vulnerability\nCisco FWSM is affected by a denial of service vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause a reload when sending a series of TCP packets. The Cisco FWSM is only affected by this vulnerability when is configured in multi-mode (with virtual firewalls) and configured to accept Telnet, SSH or ASDM connections. A  TCP three-way handshake is needed to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability is only triggered by traffic that is destined to the affected device; transit traffic does not trigger this vulnerability.",
