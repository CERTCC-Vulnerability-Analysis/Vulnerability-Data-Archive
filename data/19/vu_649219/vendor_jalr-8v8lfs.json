AMD have issued the following statement: AMD processors' SYSRET behavior is such that a non-canonical address in RCX does not generate a #GP while in CPL0. We have verified this with our architecture team, with our design team, and have performed tests that verified this on silicon. Therefore, this privilege escalation exposure is not applicable to any AMD processor. This statement comes from the Xen security advisory.",
