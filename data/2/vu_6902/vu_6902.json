  "Description": "1. Machine A runs a Java application.\n\n2. Machine B downloads an applet from machine A and runs it within\nHotJava.  This applets passes a remote reference of itself (using RMI)\nto the application running on machine A.\n\n3. Machine C downloads an applet from machine A and runs it within\nHotJava.  This applet contacts the application on machine A (using\nRMI) and gets the remote reference of the applet running on machine B.\n\n4. The application on machine A terminates.  (In fact, the machine A can\nbe turned off.)\n\n5. The applet running on machine C can invoke methods of the applet\nrunning on machine B (again, using RMI).  Which clearly indicates\ndirect applet-to-applet communication.",
