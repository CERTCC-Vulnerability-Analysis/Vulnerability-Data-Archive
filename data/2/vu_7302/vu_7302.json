  "Description": "% uname -a\nIRIX saturn 6.2 03131015 IP22\n\nOn our IRIX 6.2 system (a R5000 Indy), any user can obtain root access from\nthe login (clogin) screen via the `Help' facility which is accessible via\nthe F1 function key.\n\nThis bug was reported earlier for the IRIX 5.2 operating system, where it\nwas even easier to reproduce.  On IRIX 6.2 it is somewhat harder to get the\nroot shell, but it still is possible.  Here is what I observed on an\notherwise unloaded machine (it was *more* difficult to reproduce this on a\nheavily loaded machine (10 simultaneous processes running in the\nbackground)):\n\n- Log out.\n\n- On the login screen (the one where the images of the users are displayed),\nwith the mouse pointer over the login area in the center of the screen,\nthe `F1' function key invokes `sgihelp' with some helptext on the login\nprocedure.  The new window removes its menubar as soon as possible, so\nthe `File' menu with the `print' entry is not accessible.\nIn IRIX 5.2, if one pressed F1 again in this window, another help screen\npopped up with a complete menu bar and thus access to the print facility.\nFrom there it was only a small step to the root access by chosing an\n`appropriate' printing filter.\n\n-> The goal is to obtain a help window on the login screen with the `file'\nmenu not removed.\n\n- In IRIX 6.2, if one presses F1 on the login screen, a small temporary\nwindow pops up and informs about the start of SGIhelp.  The help window\nthen pops up.  If one now presses F1 again on this help window, a\nconfirmation window with a blue `!' icon pops up and tells the user that\nsome documents could not be opened.  The only possible action is to press\nthe OK button which removes both the confirmation and the help window.\n\n- If one presses F1 not once, but multiple times quickly in a row,\nsimultaneously moving and clicking the mouse, the following can be\nobserved:\n- at certain times, an error button with a red error sign pops up telling\nthe user that some documents could not be opened.\n- if one presses F1 over the small temporary window indicating the start\nof SGIhelp, one can achieve that multiple versions of the help screen\nare piled up.  Some help windows thus do not disappear when pressing\nall visible OK buttons.\n- Now press F1 again multiple times while clicking on both the SGIhelp\nannouncement window and the help window which is still visible.\n- multiple error and warnings windows will pop up, but eventually you\nwill get an help window which displays some online book\n*** with the top menu bar not removed ***\nwhich is what we wanted :-)\n- I typically have to play around for 2-3 minutes until I get there.  The\nessential point seems to be to get multiple help screens running (by\nquickly pressing F1 in multiple places, including the login screen, the\nnewly created confirmation and error windows, the `starting SGIhelp...'\nannouncement window), and then repeat this process until eventually the\nhelp window with the menubar comes up.",
