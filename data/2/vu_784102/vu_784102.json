  "Impact": "By convincing a victim to view an HTML document (web page, HTML email), an attacker could evaluate script in a different security domain than the one containing the attacker's document. If the script is evaluated in the Local Machine Zone, the attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running IE. The attacker could also read or modify data in other web sites (read cookies/content, modify/create content, etc.).",

  "Workarounds": "Disable Active scripting and ActiveX controls Disable Active scripting and ActiveX controls for untrusted sites. At a minimum, disable Active scripting in the Internet Zone and the zone used by Outlook, Outlook Express, or any other software that uses the WebBrowser ActiveX control or the IE HTML rendering engine (MSHTML). Instructions for disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls can be found in the CERT/CC Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Apply the Outlook Email Security Update Another way to effectively disable Active scripting and ActiveX controls in Outlook is to install the Outlook Email Security Update. The update configures Outlook to open email messages in the Restricted Sites Zone, where Active scripting and ActiveX controls are disabled by default. In addition, the update provides further protection against malicious code that attempts to propagate via Outlook. The Outlook Email Security Update is available for Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000. The functionality of the Outlook Email Security Update is included in Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6. Render email in plain text Configure email client software (mail user agent [MUA]) to render email messages in plaint text. Instructions to configure Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6 are available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles 307594 and 291387, respectively. HTML-formatted email messages may not appear properly, however script will not be evaluated, thus preventing certain types of attacks. Maintain updated antivirus software Antivirus software with updated virus definitions may identify and prevent some exploit attempts. Variations of exploits or attack vectors may not be detected. Do not rely on antivirus software to defend against this vulnerability. The CERT/CC maintains a partial list of antivirus vendors. Use a different web browser There are a number of significant vulnerabilities in technologies relating to the IE domain/zone security model, the DHTML object model, MIME type determination, and ActiveX. It is possible to reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities by using a different web browser. Such a decision may, however, reduce the functionality of sites that require IE-specific features such as DHTML, VBScript, and ActiveX. Note that using a different web browser will not remove IE from a Windows system, and other programs may invoke IE, the WebBrowser ActiveX control, or the HTML rendering engine (MSHTML).",
