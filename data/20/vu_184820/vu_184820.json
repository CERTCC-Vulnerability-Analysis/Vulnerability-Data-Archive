  "Workarounds": "Disable JavaScript Acrobat JavaScript can be disabled in the General preferences dialog (Edit > Preferences > General > JavaScript). Restrict Access to Plug-ins Directory Use NTFS file permissions to prevent users from writing to the Plug-ins directory (typically C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Acrobat 5.0\\Acrobat\\Plug_ins). This will protect against the W32.Yourde virus, but it will not prevent malicious JavaScript from writing to other locations. Remove JavaScript Plug-in Remove the JavaScript plug-in (EScript.api) from the Plug-ins directory. This will effectively disable Acrobat JavaScript and may cause other unexpected results. Maintain Anti-Virus Software As a general best practice, maintain updated anti-virus software. Links to anti-virus vendors and other information are available on the Computer Virus Resources page.",
