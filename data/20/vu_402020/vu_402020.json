  "Description": "CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'): Autodesk VRED Professional 2014 contains an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability. Autodesk VRED Professional 2014 contains an integrated web server that binds to port tcp/8888 which is accessible remotely. It has been reported that this web server gives access to a Python API which provides users with a vast amount of libraries which could allow an attacker to execute operating system commands. Through this API, Python code can be executed on the target system, the output is returned in the web server response. By importing the Python \u201cos\u201d library, arbitrary operating system commands can be executed on the target system with the privileges of the user running VRED Professional 2014.",
