  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. In tests, the public exploit code crashes the RPCSS service on Windows 2000 and Windows XP systems patched with MS03-039. The exploit executes code on Windows 2000 systems that do not have the MS03-039 patch.",
