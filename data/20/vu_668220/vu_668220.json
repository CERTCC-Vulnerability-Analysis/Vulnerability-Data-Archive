  "Description": "RFC 3173 defines the IP Payload Compression Protocol (IPComp) as: IP payload compression is a protocol to reduce the size of IP datagrams. This protocol will increase the overall communication performance between a pair of communicating hosts/gateways (\"nodes\") by compressing the datagrams, provided the nodes have sufficient computation power, through either CPU capacity or a compression coprocessor, and the communication is over slow or congested links. IPComp is commonly used in conjunction with IPsec implementations. Some network stack implementations, particularly those incorporating the KAME project or NetBSD project IPComp and IPsec implementations, may fail to check for stack overflow in their recursive handling of nested IPComp-encapsulated payloads. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to cause kernel memory corruption.",
