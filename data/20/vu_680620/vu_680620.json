  "Impact": "A remote attacker be able to exploit this vulnerability by supplying the inflate() routine with specially crafted compressed data. As a result, applications linked to the zlib library may abruptly and abnormally terminate resulting in a denial-of-service condition. According to public reports, this vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, but we have not confirmed this.",
