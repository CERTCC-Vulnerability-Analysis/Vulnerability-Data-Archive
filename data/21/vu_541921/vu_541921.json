  "Description": "ISC DHCP is a commonly redistributed reference implementation of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), including a server, client, and relay agent. The server component contains a fencepost error in the way that it handles client identifiers. As a result, a request from a client system containing a zero-length client id will cause the server to exit. ISC indicates that this vulnerability affects ISC-DHCP versions 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x but not 3.1.x. We are aware of publicly available exploit code for this vulnerability.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade or apply a patch from the vendor \nPatches and updated versions of the software have been released to address this issue. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more information. Users who compile their DHCP software from the original source distribution should upgrade to one of the following versions: 4.1.1-P1 or 4.0.2-P1.",
