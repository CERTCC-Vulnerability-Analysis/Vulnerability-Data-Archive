  "Overview": "Locally exploiting a buffer overflow within libIM allows an attacker to\nobtain the privileges of an application calling the library. The\n\"/usr/lpp/X11/bin/aixterm\" binary calls the libIM library and is then\ninstalled setuid root by default on AIX. The \"-im\" command line argument used by aixterm causes the binary to crash\nwhen filled with a string about 50 bytes in length. This allows an\nattacker to gain control of the return address of the executing function,\nthereby allowing code execution with root privileges.",
