  "Workarounds": "Disable scripting Disable scripting in your web browser, as specified in the Securing Your Web Browser document and the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. This can also be accomplished by adding \"ebay.com\" to the Restricted Sites zone in Internet Explorer. Users of Mozilla-based browsers can use Configurable Security Policies (CAPS) to disable scripting for the \"ebay.com\" web site. Validate web site addresses When interacting with web sites, pay close attention to the web site address displayed by the browser. Especially when providing login information, make sure  the web browser is displaying the proper URL, as described in the eBay Spoof Email Tutorial and US-CERT Cyber Security Tip ST04-014. Validate web site certificates Web sites may require sensitive information such as passwords or credit card information. In these cases, make sure the web site is using an encrypted (HTTPS) connection. Validate the web site certificate, as described in US-CERT Cyber Security Tip ST05-010.",
