  "Description": "(From SNI Draft) Use of an undocumented UDP port under Solaris 2.X for rpcbind.\n\nUnder Solaris 2.x, rpcbind listens not only on TCP port 111, and UDP port\n111, but also on UDP port 32771.  This results in a large number of packet\nfilters which intend to block access to rpcbind/portmapper being\nineffective.  Instead of sending requests to TCP or UDP port 111, the\nattacker simply sends them to UDP port 32771.",

  "Workarounds": "1. Block incoming packets destined for TCP port 111, UDP port 111, and UDP\nport 32771. This will deny access to portmapper and rpcbind for\noutsiders. Note that while this prevents standard RPC clients from being\nable to access SunRPC services, it is still possible for individuals\noutside your network to access RPC services. 2. Block all packets from outside networks which have source addresses\nassociated with inside machines.",
