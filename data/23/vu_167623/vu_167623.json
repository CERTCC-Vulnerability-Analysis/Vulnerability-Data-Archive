  "Description": "CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check - CVE-2016-6567 SHDesigns' Resident Download Manager provides firmware update capabilities for Rabbit 2000/3000 CPU boards, which according to the reporter may be used in some industrial control and embedded applications. The Resident Download Manager does not verify that the firmware is authentic before executing code and deploying the firmware to devices. A remote attacker with the ability to send UDP traffic to the device may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. According to SHDesigns' website, the Resident Download Manager and other Rabbit Tools have been discontinued since June 2011.", 
  "CVSS_AccessComplexity": "M", 
  "CVSS_SecurityRequirementsAR": "ND", 
  "Resolution": "The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. According to the reporter, affected users may disable the network update feature. It is also possible that developers of products using the Resident Download Manager may be able to write a download verification wrapper around the Resident Download Manager library, but may not be practical in all scenarios.",
