  "Description": "A site under denial of service attack puts forth the following\nscenario:\n\n1) attacker forges broadcast echo packets to victim1, that is, ICMP\nECHO REQUEST packets of the form xxx.xxx.255.255. The source\naddress is forged to appear to be victim2.\n\n2) all the machines on xxx.xxx reply to victim2, thus generating a\npretty big packet storm on both networks, and all the nets in\nbetween.\n\nYou can thus leverage a class C network to generate packets ~255\ntimes as fast as you can generate them (though it will be somewhat\nbursty, rather than steady). Similarly for bigger networks.\n\nIn addition, there appears (after consultation with wlf) to be an\noption in Ciscos to rewrite packets of the form xxx.xxx.255.255 to\n255.255.255.255. If an important router or two were misconfigured\nin this way, lots and lots of machines could be made to generate\npackets destined to victim2.",
