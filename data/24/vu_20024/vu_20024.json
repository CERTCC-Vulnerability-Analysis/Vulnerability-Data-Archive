  "Description": "FROM:  AUSCERT AA-97.05\n\n    The SGI IRIS Digital Media Execution Environment contains the basic\n    system components necessary to support audio, MIDI (Musical Instrument\n    Digital Interface), and video applications on an IRIS workstation.\n    One part of this product is the MIDI Execution Environment, which\n    among other things, contains the startmidi/stopmidi program.  stopmidi\n    is a symbolic link to the startmidi program.\n\n    Before any MIDI applications can be run, it is usually necessary to\n    configure the serial ports for use with MIDI.  startmidi initializes\n    the serial ports and links them to the MIDI streams driver. stopmidi\n    disables MIDI on the specified device.\n\n    During the execution of startmidi, files are created in an insecure\n    manner with insecure permissions.  As this program executes with root\n    privileges, it is possible for local users to create or truncate\n    arbitrary files on the system.  It also possible to alter the contents\n    of these temporary files, which may allow users to perform a denial\n    of service attack.\n\n    Exploit information has been made publicly available.\n\n    The default location for startmidi/stopmidi is /usr/sbin/.\n\n    IRIX 5.x and 6.x systems, loaded with Digital Media Tools by default,\n    are known to contain this vulnerability.  Sites can determine the\n    version of the operating system with the command:\n\n        % /sbin/uname -a",
