  "Description": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key - Multiple CVEs Research by Stefan Viehb\u00f6ck of SEC Consult has found that numerous embedded devices accessible on the public Internet use non-unique X.509 certificates and SSH host keys. Products are identified as vulnerable if unpacked firmware images are found to contain hard-coded keys or certificates whose fingerprints can be matched to data from the Internet-wide scan data repository, scans.io (specifically, see SSH results and SSL certificates). Affected devices range broadly from home routers and IP cameras to VOIP phones. For the majority of vulnerable devices, reuse of certificates and keys are limited to the product lines of individual vendors. There are some instances where identical certificates and keys are used by multiple vendors. In these cases, the root cause may be due to firmware that is developed from common SDKs, or OEM devices using ISP-provided firmware. Vulnerable devices may be subject to impersonation, man-in-the-middle, or passive decryption attacks. It may be possible for an attacker to obtain credentials or other sensitive information that may be used in further attacks. For additional details about the research and affected products by certificates and SSH host keys, refer to the original SEC Consult blog post on the topic, as well as the nine-month follow-up blog.",

  "Workarounds": "Change X.509 certificates or SSH host keys Where possible, users of affected devices should manually replace X.509 certificates or SSH host keys so that they are unique to the device. Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent a capable attacker from intercepting and decrypting vulnerable communications, but it may limit an attacker's ability to make use of compromised credentials from an untrusted host.",
