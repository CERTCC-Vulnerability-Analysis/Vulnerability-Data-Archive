  "Description": "ZTE F460/F660 cable modems contain an unauthenticated backdoor. The web_shell_cmd.gch script accepts unauthenticated commands that have administrative access to the device. It has been reported that the web_shell_cmd.gch script is sometimes accessible from the WAN interface making exploitation of this backdoor from the Internet possible in certain cases. Additional details may be found in Rapid7's R7-2013-18 advisory. ZTE has provided a statement about this vulnerability.",
