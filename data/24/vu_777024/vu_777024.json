  "Description": "Netgear Management System NMS300 is a configuration, monitoring, and diagnostics utility for managing SNMP networked devices via a web interface. CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type - CVE-2016-1524 Default installations of NMS300 operate two Java servlets, http://<IP>:8080/fileUpload.do and http://<IP>:8080/lib-1.0/external/flash/fileUpload.do, that can be accessed by unauthenticated users. By sending a specially crafted POST request to the servlets, an attacker can upload arbitrary files that will then be accessible from the NMS300 server's root directory as http://<IP>:8080/null<filename>. The NMS300 server runs with SYSTEM privileges. CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') - CVE-2016-1525 NMS300 contains a directory traversal vulnerability. An authenticated attacker can manipulate the realName parameter of a crafted POST request sent to http://<IP>:8080/data/config/image.do?method=add to load an arbitrary local file from the server host to a predictable location in the web service. The file can then be downloaded from http://<IP>:8080/data/config/image.do?method=export&imageId=<ID>, where <ID> is a count that increments by one every time a file is uploaded in this manner. For more information, refer to Pedro Ribeiro's disclosure. The CVSS score describes CVE-2016-1524.",
