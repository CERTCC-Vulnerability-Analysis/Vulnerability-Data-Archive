  "Description": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values - CVE-2015-8265 Huawei Mobile WiFi E5151 and E5186 routers use static source ports for all DNS queries originating from the local area network (LAN). An attacker with the ability to spoof DNS responses can cause E5151 or E5186 LAN clients to contact incorrect or malicious hosts under the attacker's control. The following graph shows a distribution of 114 DNS queries captured on the WAN port of the E5151:",
