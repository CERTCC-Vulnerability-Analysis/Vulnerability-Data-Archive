  "VendorStatement": "MarkLogic Corporation acknowledges CERT Vulnerability Notes VU#103425 and \nVU#520721 and confirms that an affected version of Oracle Outside In is bundled \nand shipped with MarkLogic Server versions 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2. Outside In file \nconversion is a keyed option in MarkLogic Server. The Outside In converters \ncannot be accessed from within the MarkLogic Server programming environment \nwithout an installed license key that enables the Outside In conversion \noption. The Outside In conversion option for MarkLogic Server has not been \nadvertised and circulation is highly restricted. Therefore, the security risk \nimposed by the bundled Outside In utility on the MarkLogic user community is \nextremely limited. Regardless, the affected Outside In libraries have been removed from MarkLogic \nServer 4.1 (4.1-11) and 4.2 (4.2-6) and will be absent in all future \nmaintenance releases for those codelines. Further, Outside In will be removed \nentirely from upcoming MarkLogic Server version 5.0.",
