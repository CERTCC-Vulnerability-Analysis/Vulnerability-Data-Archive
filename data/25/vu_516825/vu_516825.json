  "Impact": "Because Sun RPC-derived XDR libraries are used by a variety of vendors in a variety of applications, this defect may lead to a number of differing security problems. Exploiting this vulnerability will lead to denial of service, execution of arbitrary code, or the disclosure of sensitive information. Furthermore, because RPC services often run as root on affected systems, this vulnerability may be leveraged to gain remote root access on vulnerable systems.",

Although the library was originally distributed by Sun Microsystems, multiple vendors have included the vulnerable code in their own implementations. Some implementations of standard functions in this API may contain an integer overflow.",
