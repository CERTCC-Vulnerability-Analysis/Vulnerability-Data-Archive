  "Description": "CWE-212: Improper Cross-boundary Removal of Sensitive Data - CVE-2016-5134 (Google), CVE-2016-1801 (Apple) Web proxy auto-configuration files (proxy.pac) have access to the full URL including the path and parameters in HTTPS GET requests, which may expose sensitive data intended to be protected by HTTPS. This information is passed to the FindProxyForURL() function in the proxy.pac. The PAC file is often retrieved by the browser automatically using the WPAD protocol. An attacker in the position to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks may provide a malicious PAC file capable of exploiting the FindProxyForURL() function to exfiltrate sensitive data.",
