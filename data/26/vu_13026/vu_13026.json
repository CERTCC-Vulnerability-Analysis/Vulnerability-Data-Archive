  "Description": "This new set of sendmail patches fixes several security holes which\ncame to light after the release of our 21 October set. Aside from\n101352-02, a forthcoming x86-based patch which corresponds to the\nSPARC-based patches being released today, no further security-\nrelated sendmail patches are planned at this time. Our plans for\n101352-02 are described in section I.C.1 below.\n\nWe have included with these patches a new set of sample\nconfiguration files. These illustrate the use of the \"%l\"\noperator, a feature from the Solaris 2.x sendmail which, with\nthese patches, is now available in the 4.1.x sendmail as well. No\nchanges have been made to the documented Solaris 2.x\nfunctionality.",
