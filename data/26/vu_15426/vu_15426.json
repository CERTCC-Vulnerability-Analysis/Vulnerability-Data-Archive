  "Description": "In some example CGI-bin programs distributed with popular HTTP\ndaemons, some variables are set and echoed using the following\nformat:\n\necho QUERY_STRING = \"$QUERY_STRING\"\n\nWhen a client formulates the correct format for these variables, the\necho instruction essentially acts as a default \"ls\" command on the\nserver. This allows the client to inspect the directories of the\nserver system.\n\nA known example is nph-test-cgi.\n\nIn some cases, these CGI bin scripts have been modified since April\n1996 by vendors. In some cases though, it is believed that\ndefective scripts are still used at some sites.",
