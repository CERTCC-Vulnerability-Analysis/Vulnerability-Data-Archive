  "Description": "Multiple current BIOS implementations are still vulnerable to a known Intel CPU cache poisoning attack that could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into SMRAM. The attack was initially discovered by Rafal Wojtczuk[0] and Loic Duflot[1] and later expanded upon[2] by Corey Kallenberg, John Butterworth, Xeno Kovah, and Sam Cornwell of The MITRE Corporation. According to Corey Kallenberg of The MITRE Corporation, newer systems provide \"protected region\" registers that would prevent this type of attack. In practice, however, some implementations still rely exclusively on the BIOS Write Enable (BIOSWE) bit for BIOS flash protection. CERT/CC has reached out to vendors with affected system models and will update this vulnerability note on an ongoing basis as other affected models are discovered and/or patched. If you are aware of a model that is affected and is not yet listed here, please let us know.
