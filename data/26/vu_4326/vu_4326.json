  "Description": "EXCERPTS from Central Command warning of Win95.CIH\n\nThis is a Windows 95 specific parasitic PE files (Portable Executable) \ninfector about 1Kbyte of length.  This virus was found \"in-the-wild\" in\nTaiwan in June 1998 - it was posted by the virus author to a local\nInternet conference as a utility.  The virus installs itself into the Windows memory, hooks\nfile access calls and infects EXE files that are opened.  Depending on the\nsystem date (see below) the virus runs its trigger routine.  The virus has\nsome bugs and in some cases halts the computer when a infected application\nis run. The virus' trigger routine operates with Flash BIOS ports and\ntries to overwrite Flash memory with \"garbage\".  This is possible only if\nmotherboard and chipset allows writing to Flash memory.  Usually writing\nto Flash memory can be disabled by a DIP switch, however this depends on\nthe motherboard design.  Unfortunately, there are modern motherboard that\ncannot be protected by a DIP switch - some of them ignore the switch\nposition and this protection has no effect at all, for other hardware,\nwrite protection can be disabled/overridden by software.   The trigger routine then\noverwrites data on all installed hard drives.  The virus uses direct disk\nwrite calls and bypasses standard BIOS virus protection while overwriting\nthe MBR and boot sectors.\n\n1003    CCIH 1.2 TTIT     Activates on April 26th\n1010    CCIH 1.3 TTIT     Activates on April 26th\n1019    CCIH 1.4 TATUNG   Activates on 26th of any month",
