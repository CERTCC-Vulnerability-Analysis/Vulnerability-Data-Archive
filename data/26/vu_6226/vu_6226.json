  "Description": "The bug is in the code that is used when\ngenerating a reflection to an ICMP \"ping\".  Each IP datagram\nhas a variable length \"options\" field, which has various\nsub-records in it.  Some of these subrecords have a variable\nlength as well.  It is possible to send a packet to a machine\nwhich has one of these subrecords' length set to zero (or\nnegative, because of a programming error with signed\ncharacters), and the code that is supposed to parse these\nvalues will never reach the end of the list. This causes the\nkernel to halt in the ip_stripoptions() routine indefinately.",
