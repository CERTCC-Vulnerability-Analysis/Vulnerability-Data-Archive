  "Impact": "By sending a specially crafted BGP packet to an affected device, a remote attacker could cause the device to reload. Repeated exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a denial-of-service condition. Because BGP must be configured to accept traffic from an explicitly defined peer, exploitation would be difficult from an untrusted host.",
