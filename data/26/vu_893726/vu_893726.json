  "Description": "It has been reported that Zyxel P660 series modem/router (and possibly other models which share the same core firmware) fail to parse a high volume of SYN packets on the web management interface correctly causing the device to reboot. By default, the device runs a web management interface on port tcp/80 which is accessible remotely (LAN and WAN sides).",
