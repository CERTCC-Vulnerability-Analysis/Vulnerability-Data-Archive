  "Overview": "OpenSSH is an implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. It can be configured to use Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) for added authentication. A vulnerability exists in OpenSSH, and perhaps other implementations of SSH, which can allow to potentially bypass PAM restrictions.",
