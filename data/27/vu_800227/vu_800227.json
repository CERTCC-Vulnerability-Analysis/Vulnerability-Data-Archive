  "Description": "According to the vendor's website: \"OneOrZero AIMS is a powerful enterprise ready suite that includes a help desk, knowledge base, time manager and reporting system supported by a highly configurable and extensible Action & Information Management System that allows you to 'build your own system' on the fly.\" AIMS is susceptible to an authentication bypass. An attacker can generate a session cookie for $_COOKIE['oozimsrememberme'] and log in as an administrator without providing a password. AIMS is also susceptible to SQL injection. On line 136 of lib\\ooz_access.php the $cookieName variable that originates from an attacker controllable cookie is passed to a SQL statement without any filtering: $sql = \"SELECT * FROM \" . OOZ_SET_TABLE_PREFIX . \"users WHERE user_name = '\" . $cookieName . $userResult = DB::query($sql, DSN, OOZ_SET_SHOW_SQL);",
