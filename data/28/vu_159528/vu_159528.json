  "Description": "According to ISC: If a TCP connection is established to the server on a port which has been configured for communication with a failover peer, this can cause it to become non-responsive to all normal DHCP protocol traffic. The server will progress to a communications-interrupted state - but in addition will also cease to provide DHCP services to clients. The server must be restarted to resume normal operation. This can be used as an attack vector against servers that are configured for failover partnerships.",
