  "Workarounds": "Workaround Sun has issued the following workaround for this vulnerability: To workaround this issue, disable all instances of the Kernel SSL Proxy service and re-configure applications which may depend on them. Note that this will remove the benefits otherwise gained by the Kernel SSL Proxy, such as the performance enhancements. To disable the Kernel SSL Proxy service, the svcadm(1M) command can be used for each instance of the service: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# svcadm disable svc:/network/ssl/proxy:<instance_suffix>\nTo disable and delete the Kernel SSL Proxy service, the ksslcfg(1M) can be used for each instance of the service: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# ksslcfg delete [host] <ssl_port>",
