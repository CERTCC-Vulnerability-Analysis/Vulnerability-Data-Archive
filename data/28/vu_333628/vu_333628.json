  "Impact": "The full impact of these vulnerabilities is unclear. The most likely impact is that the heap may be corrupted leading to a denial of service. If it is possible to exploit this vulnerability in a manner that would allow the execution of arbitrary code, then an attacker may be able to so with the privileges of the user running the sshd process, usually root. The impact may be limited on systems using the privilege separation feature available in OpenSSH for some systems.",
