  "Description": "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') - CVE-2015-7254 In vulnerable Huawei router models, the /icon/ path of requests to Internet-facing TCP port 37215 can be manipulated to gain access to arbitrary files. For instance, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could read the inittab file by directly requesting http://<target_IP>:37215/icon/../../../etc/inittab.",
