  "Impact": "An attacker who has the ability to sniff packets as they cross the network or has access to logs on the LDAP servers can acquire the plaintext passwords of users authenticating to the Kerberos system. The attacker could subsequently use these passwords to impersonate the corresponding users and gain the privileges of that principle in the Kerberos realm.",
