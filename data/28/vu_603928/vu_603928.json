  "Description": "According to Ecava's website: IntegraXor is a suite of tools used to create and run a web-based HMI interface for a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Ecava IntegraXor is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when more than 1024 bytes are written to the fixed-size stack buffer. When an exploit sends a request greater than 1024 bytes, IntegraXor writes past the buffer bounds and corrupts memory, allowing execution of arbitrary code.",
