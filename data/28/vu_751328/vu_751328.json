  "Description": "CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal - CVE-2015-6003 When the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) is enabled, any OS X user account (including the unauthenticated guest account) may be able to read and write arbitrary files on the QNAP QTS device. According to documentation, AFP is disabled by default on the device, so only users specifically enabling this service are impacted. According to the reporter, the TS-420 with firmware version prior to 4.1.4 Build 0910 is vulnerable. It is likely that all devices running firmware version 4.1.4 are affected; previous firmware versions may also be affected. For more information, please see QNAP's security advisory.",

  "Resolution": "Update the firmware QNAP has released firmware version QTS 4.1.4 Build 0910 and QTS 4.2.0 Build 0910(RC2) to address this issue. Affected users are encouraged to update as soon as possible.",
