  "Workarounds": "Disable the displaying of PDF documents in the web browser Preventing PDF documents from opening inside a web browser may prevent this vulnerability from being automatically exploited. If this workaround is applied to updated versions of the Adobe reader, it may mitigate future vulnerabilities. To prevent PDF documents from automatically being opened in a web browser: Open Adobe Acrobat Reader. Open the Edit menu. Choose the preferences option. Choose the Internet section. Un-check the \"Display PDF in browser\" check box. Prevent Internet Explorer from automatically opening PDF documents The installer for Adobe Reader and Acrobat configures Internet Explorer to automatically open PDF files without any user interaction. This behavior can be reverted to the safer option of prompting the user by importing the following as a .REG file: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\AcroExch.Document.7] \"EditFlags\"=hex:00,00,00,00 Disable JavaScript in Adobe Reader and Acrobat Disabling Javascript may prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. Acrobat JavaScript can be disabled in the General preferences dialog (Edit -> Preferences -> JavaScript and un-check Enable Acrobat JavaScript). Do not open untrusted PDF files Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected PDF attachments. Users can convert PDF documents to text by using the Adobe Online Conversion Tools site. See the Online Conversion Tools FAQ for information about this service. This workaround will not mitigate all attack vectors.",
