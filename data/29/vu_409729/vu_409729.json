  "Impact": "This represents a fundamental security vulnerability to customers who depend on the UEFI BIOS to prevent the installation of rootkits. An attacker with the exposed keys could potentially sign arbitrary code, write data onto a customer\u2019s machine, and flash the BIOS with rootkit functionality. This type of attack would circumvent features in the BIOS that prevents firmware rollbacks and the installation of unsigned or test-signed firmware.",

  "Description": "In early April 2013 security researchers discovered the public sharing of source, documentation, and cryptographic keys for the AMI BIOS. The cryptographic keys that were exposed were the public and private test keys that AMI provided partners for the development and internal testing of their UEFI compliant products. Subsequently it was discovered that various partners had signed their production BIOS with the test key.",
