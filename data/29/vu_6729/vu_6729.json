  "Description": "The domain name system (DNS), which is implemented\nwith the BIND (also called \"named\") program, can be spoofed.\nIt is possible for an intruder at site A to convince site B\nthat s/he is really coming from site C.  If B trusts C and does\nnot require further authentication, then an intrustion can take place.\nFor details, see the ./papers directory.",
