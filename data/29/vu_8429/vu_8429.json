  "Description": "When a web server receives a request from a client, sometimes the\nrequested page is at another location.\n\nSometimes the script at the server will simply return a reference\nto the correct page which the client will access automatically.\nThere is also the possibility (depending upon the script and the\nserver configuration) that the server will automatically retrieve\nthe correct page of its own accord.\n\nThe problem arises when the page that the client wishes to access\nis protected.  Assume that the requested page is available only to\nclients running on the server.\n\nUsing the first model (where the client is redirected to retrieve\nthe page), access to the page is (correctly) denied since the page\ncame from the client.  In the second case though, the request\nsucceeds because the request for the page came from the server,\nalthough the request was initiated by the client.  In this way, it\nis possible for the client to bypass access controls on a protected\npage.",
