  "Impact": "If an attacker can convince a user to install a widget, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands or code with the privileges of the user. This execution would take place when the user runs what appears to be a system widget. By default, Safari on OS X 10.4 downloads and installs widgets without any user interaction or notification (VU#775661).",

  "Workarounds": "Install an update This issue is addressed by the OS X 10.4.2 update. With this update, OS X will warn the user if a widget to be installed will override an existing widget. User-installed widgets will still override system-installed widgets, but this change will help prevent accidental installation of a widget that has the same CFBundleIdentifier value as an existing widget. Disable \"Open 'safe' files after downloading\" By default, Safari will open \"safe\" files after downloading them. This includes movies, pictures, sounds, documents, disk images, and widgets. By disabling this option, Safari will prompt before installing widgets. By not automatically opening files, Safari will not automatically execute other software to handle downloaded files. Other software may contain vulnerabilities, and some \"safe\" files may contain code, place content in a known location, or otherwise contribute to an attack. To disable this option, select \"Preferences\" from the Safari menu and uncheck the option \"Open 'safe' files after downloading,\" as specified in the Securing Your Web Browser document. Do not open untrusted Dashboard widgets Dashboard widgets may give the impression that they are harmless web applets. Widgets are effectively arbitrary OS X code. Do not download, install, or execute arbitrary code, including widgets.",
