  "Description": "An authenticated user with no permission to a project can subscribe to the project, delete files, and possibly take other actions by loading a specifically crafted URL. Specific fields for the URL would most likely not be known to the attacker but a brute force attack could still be used to try all possibilities. ActiveCollab 2.3.1 is known to be vulnerable. Earlier versions may be vulnerable as well.",
