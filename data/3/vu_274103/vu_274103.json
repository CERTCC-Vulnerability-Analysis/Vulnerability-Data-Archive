  "Description": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password - CVE-2015-2867\nDuring the TRANE ComfortLink II system boot, the SCC service installs two sets of user credentials with hard-coded passwords. These credentials allow root privileges and can be used to remotely access the system over SSH. An attacker with knowledge of the credentials may gain root access to the device. CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') - CVE-2015-2868\nAn attacker who can connect to the DSS service on the Trane ComfortLink II device can send an overly long request that can overflow a fixed size stack buffer, which may result in a denial-of-service or arbitrary code execution. This results from improper usage of the C functions strcpy and sscanf. The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2015-2867.",
