  "Workarounds": "From Cisco's statement: The workaround for users running Cisco IOS 11.x code is to block all ICMP redirect messages that are sent to the router itself. That can be accomplished this way: router(config)#access-list 101 deny icmp any host <device_IP> redirect\n .... (the rest of the access-list 101) router(config)#interface eth0\n router(config-if)#ip access-group 101 in This example will block all ICMP packets, sent to the router itself, coming from the eth0 interface. All transit ICMP redirect packets will be allowed through. Although, Cisco IOS 12.x code is less exposed we recommend to block all ICMP redirect packets sent to the device itself.",
