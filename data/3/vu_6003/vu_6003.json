  "Workarounds": "1) remove the help system entirely\n# versions remove sgihelp.sw.eoe\nor\n# mv /usr/sbin/sgihelp /usr/sbin/sgihelp.disabled\nImpact: No application can provide help. 2) remove a portion of the help system\n# versions remove sgihelp.books.ViewerHelp\nand unsetuid the printers and PrintStatus programs\n# chmod ug-s /usr/sbin/{printers,PrintStatus}\nImpact: Help from CLOGIN is limited. Users who normally\nhave the priviledge of using printers and PrintStatus\nto manipulate the printers cannot do so. Fixes: SGI is (1) patching the Help system to setuid(getuid())\nso that setuid programs which call Help are protectedr; (2) are making some patch to the two setuid programs\n(I do not yet have details on this patch), and (3) fixed\nCLOGIN so you cannot get Help-on-Help withing CLOGIN\nwhich prevents you from reaching the print menu. They plan to make these patches available via anonymous FTP\nand plan to cut CDs for distribution. They believe they have checked all other setuid programs\nto ensure they don't have a similar problem.",
