  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the Apache process. Since the Apache service typically runs with SYSTEM privileges on Windows NT and Windows 2000, an attacker may be able to gain complete control of the system.",

It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall may be able to filter requests made to Apache.

  "Overview": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Apache Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). An HTTP Authorization header with a crafted password parameter could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Apache service.",
