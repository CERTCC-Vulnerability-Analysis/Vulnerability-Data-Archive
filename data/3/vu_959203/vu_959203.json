See Cisco's Response for its instructions on how to configure the filtering.",

  "Overview": "Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) is the operating system for the majority of Cisco routers. Open Shortest-Path First (OSPF) is an interior routing protocol. A flaw in some Cisco IOS versions can allow a buffer overflow when handling a large number of OSPF neighbor connection requests.",
