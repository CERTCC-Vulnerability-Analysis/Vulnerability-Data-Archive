  "Impact": "The most significant impact of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote intruder to gain root access to systems running vulnerable services, including the KDC for the domain. Buffer overflow in krb_rd_req() library function\nThis vulnerability may be exploited by remote users to gain root privileges on systems running services linked against the vulnerable library. As MIT indicated, these services include (but may not be limited to): krshd\nklogind (if accepting Kerberos 4 authentication)\ntelnetd (if accepting Kerberos 4 authentication)\nftpd (if accepting Kerberos 4 authentication)\nrkinitd\nkpopd Local users can execute arbitrary code as root on systems where v4rcp is installed setuid root. Buffer overflow in krb425_conv_principal() library function\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by remote users in conjunction with the krb_rd_req vulnerability to gain root privileges on systems running services linked against the vulnerable library. Buffer overflow in krshd\nRemote users may be able to execute arbitrary code as root on systems running a vulnerable version of krshd. Buffer overflow in ksu\nLocal users can can gain root privileges by exploiting the buffer overflow in ksu.",

  "Resolution": "Apply a patch from your vendor\nThe vendor section of this document contains information provided by vendors. We will update this information as we receive vendor statements. If you do not see your vendor's name, the CERT/CC did not hear from that vendor. Please contact your vendor directly. Apply the MIT patches\nIf you are running the Kerberos 5 distribution from MIT, and can rebuild your binaries from source, you can apply the source code patches from MIT to correct these problems. If you are running Kerberos version 4, you may be able to patch your source code based on the version 5 patch provided by MIT. Only the patches for the krb_rd_req() vulnerability need to be applied to version 4 to address the issues described in this document. With either version, you will need to recompile the libraries and the vulnerable programs (krshd and ksu). You will also need to recompile any programs that have been statically linked with the vulnerable libraries. In version 4, you should also recompile the KDC server software. These patches are available at: http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-06/mit_10x_patch.txt \nhttp://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-06/mit_111_patch.txt Upgrade to MIT Kerberos 5 version 1.2\nThe vulnerabilities described in this document will be addressed in Kerberos 5 version 1.2. This version will be available from the MIT Kerberos web site: http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/",

  "Overview": "The CERT Coordination Center has recently been notified of several buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Kerberos authentication software. The most severe vulnerability allows remote intruders to gain root privileges on systems running services using Kerberos authentication. If vulnerable services are enabled on the Key Distribution Center (KDC) system, the entire Kerberos domain may be compromised.",
