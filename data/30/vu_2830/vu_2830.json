  "Description": "Possible virus on SCSI disk controllers passed\nbetween HP disks.\n\n\nThe new 2Gb HP disks use a smart controller that can take its\nmicrocode directly from user sectors of the disk.  The controller can\nthen do a SCSI initiate to find other SCSI disks and propagate the\ncode.\n\nThis could spread rapidly if the virus then causes the disk to fail\nand be sent back to the factory to be used with other disk drives.\n\nThis virus is currently theoretical, but Tsutomo sees no obstacles to\nactually writing the virus.",
