  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to establish connections to services in violation of security policies. As a result, an attacker could send packets to these services that are configured to be unreachable from the WAN interface. An attacker could also leverage this flaw to exploit a vulnerability in one of these services. For instance, there is a vulnerability in the Firewall/VPN and Gateway Security appliances that allows a remote attacker to read and modify any SNMP object present on an affected device (VU#173910).",
