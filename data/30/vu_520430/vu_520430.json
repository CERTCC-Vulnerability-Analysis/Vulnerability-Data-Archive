  "Description": "According to BreakingPoint's website, the BreakingPoint Storm creates real-world, high-stress conditions and user behavior to provide organizations with the insight to battle-test IT infrastructures, train cyber warriors, tune systems and policies, and transform security processes to be proactive and effective.. BreakingPoint Systems Storm CTM contains two vulnerabilities which could allow an attacker access to sensitive configuration information. CVE-2012-2963: The BreakingPoint Systems Control Center GUI and administrative clients communicate in plaintext. All information exchanged between client and server, including the username and password, are sent in plain text XML transfers over tcp/8880. For additional information see Dell SecureWorks security advisory SWRX-2012-005. CVE-2012-2964: The BreakingPoint Systems Storm CTM administrative interface does not properly check for authorization. User-controllable requests supplied to the \u2018/gwt/BugReport\u2019 script of the embedded web server are not properly checked for authorization. An unauthenticated remote attacker can leverage this issue to retrieve a diagnostic report of the system\u2019s configuration. This report, delivered as a .tgz archive, includes sensitive information, including system logs, test results, and detailed system configuration information as well as account names and email addresses of authorized users. For additional information see Dell SecureWorks security advisory SWRX-2012-006.",
