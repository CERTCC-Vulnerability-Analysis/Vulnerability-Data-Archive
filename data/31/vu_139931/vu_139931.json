  "Impact": "An attacker who can convince a user to access a URI supplied by the attacker could cause script or HTML of the attacker's choice to be executed in the user's browser. Using this technique, an attacker may be able to take actions with the privileges of the user who accessed the URI, such as issuing queries on the underlying SQL databases and viewing the results. In Microsoft Internet Explorer, malicious script or HTML would be executed in the same zone as the vulnerable IIS server. An SQLXML-enabled IIS server in the typically less restrictive Local intranet or Trusted sites zones would allow an attacker to bypas Internet zone security settings.",
