  "Impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can pass valid data which is allowed by the rulebase through your firewall with the external IP address preserved in the destination field of the packet. Note that the standard IP spoofing protection afforded by the gateway still applies, so it is not possible to use this issue in conjunction with an attack based on a spoofed internal IP address. Note also that an attacker would not be able to directly address hosts behind the firewall.",
