  "Impact": "An attacker may be able to insert arbitrary values in the DNS cache. An attacker with the ability to conduct a successful attack can cause a nameserver's clients to contact the incorrect, and possibly malicious, hosts for particular services. Consequently, web traffic, email, and other important network data can be redirected to systems under the attacker's control.",

  "Description": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating host names to IP addresses (and vice versa) and is critical for the normal operation of internet-connected systems. Per Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-008: A response validation vulnerability exists in Windows DNS Server. The vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send specially crafted queries to a DNS server so as to allow greater predictability of transaction IDs used by the DNS server and thus to redirect Internet traffic from legitimate locations.",
