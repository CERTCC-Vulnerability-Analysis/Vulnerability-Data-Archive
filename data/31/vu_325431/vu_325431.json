  "Resolution": "The ISC has released BIND versions 4.9.8 and 8.2.3 to address this security issue. The CERT/CC recommends that users of BIND 4.9.x or 8.2.x upgrade to BIND 4.9.8 or BIND 8.2.3, respectively. Because BIND 4 is no longer actively maintained, the ISC recommends that users affected by this vulnerability upgrade to either BIND 8.2.3 or BIND 9.1. Upgrading to one of these two version will also provide functionality enhancements that are not related to security. The BIND 4.9.8 and 8.2.3 distributions can be downloaded from: ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind/src/ The BIND 9.1 distribution can be downloaded from: ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/ Please note that upgrading to BIND 4.9.8 also addresses the vulnerabilities discussed in VU#572183 and VU#868916, while upgrading to 8.2.3 will address the vulnerability discussed in VU#196945.",

  "Overview": "The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) by the Internet Software Consortium (ISC). There is an information leakage vulnerability in BIND 4.9.x and 8.2.x, which may allow remote intruders to obtain information from systems running BIND. Although BIND 4.9.x is no longer officially maintained by ISC, various versions are still widely deployed on the Internet. This vulnerability has been exploited in a laboratory environment and presents a moderate threat to the Internet infrastructure.",
