  "Description": "CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) - CVE-2015-2870 According to the reporter, <script> tags are not filtered out of a URL passed to the device, allowing an attacker to perform a reflected XSS attack. CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel - CVE-2015-2871 According to the reporter, an attacker can view and modify the existing configuration of the device without authentication by directly accessing known paths. The path varies slightly depending on model and services available. Model BF-660C: http://<host>/net.htm  -  Communication settings Model BF-630, BF-630W: http://<host>/voice.htm   -  Voice Time Set\nhttp://<host>/bf.htm   -  UniFinger Setup The reporter has identified models BF-660C, BF-630, BF-630W as being vulnerable; other models may also be vulnerable. The CERT/CC has been unable to verify this information with the vendor. The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2015-2871.",
