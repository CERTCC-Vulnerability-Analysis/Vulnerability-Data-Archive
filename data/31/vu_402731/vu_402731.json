  "Description": "The Enspire software suite includes an eClient web front-end which is susceptible to SQL injection attacks. This can be used to perform an authentication bypass or interact with the back-end database. Depending on the configuration this can lead to the compromise of the underlying host itself. Enspire version 7.3.2.7 and eClient version 7.3.2.3 are reported to be affected. Other versions may also be affected.",
