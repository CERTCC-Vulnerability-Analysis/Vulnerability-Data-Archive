  "Impact": "The specific impact of this vulnerability is dependent on the nature of the flaw in the defective ActiveX control whose kill bit has not been set. Systems running Internet Explorer may allow malicious web page authors to execute arbitrary code as the user viewing the malicious web page. The larger impact of not setting kill bits on vulnerable controls is to alter the context in which users evaluate the security of new ActiveX controls. When presented with a request to download, install, and execute a new control, users can not rely on the digital signature to ensure that there are not known problems with legitimately signed controls. Under these circumstances, new controls can not be installed without risk of exploitation.",

  "Resolution": "Use the Internet Explorer Administration Kit to limit control installation Use the Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK) to configure Internet Explorer so that only Administrator approved controls can be executed. Additionally, ensure that controls can be downloaded only from a single trusted source. In conjunction with upgrading the vulnerable controls that have already been installed, this solution is comprehensive and protects against vulnerabilities in other controls that are not approved by the administrator (by preventing their execution). Disable ActiveX in Internet Explorer This solution prevents the vulnerabilities from being exploited, but is likely to disable significant functionality in Internet Explorer. You may be able to disable ActiveX in some security zones, while leaving it enabled in others, but in the presence of cross site scripting vulnerabilities, the zone security mechanism may not be sufficient. Use a web browser that does not support ActiveX Because the browser does not support ActiveX the vulnerabilities will not be present, but in some cases you may be able to retain the functionality. For example, the vulnerability does not occur in the Netscape plugin implementation of QuickTime, allowing you to prevent exploitation without giving up the QuickTime functionality. Upgrade your controls By installing upgraded versions of the controls that do not have the vulnerabilities, you prevent malicious attackers from exploiting the vulnerability or installing the vulnerable version of the control. This solution only prevents the vulnerabilities from being exploited while the controls are installed. If you later uninstall the controls, your system would be vulnerable again. Because this solution does not protect against the installation of new vulnerable controls that do not have their kill bits set, no new controls should be downloaded, regardless of who has signed them. Set kill bits on vulnerable controls Set the kill bit on controls that are known to be vulnerable manually until you are able to upgrade to a new version of the control. This solution will be secure, but may result in lost functionality both in Internet Explorer and (in the case of the OWC controls) in other applications as well. It limits the disabled functionality to those controls with the vulnerabilities, allowing other controls to continue to execute. Killing the QuickTime control will prevent QuickTime content from being viewed in Internet Explorer: KB Article 240797 How to Stop an ActiveX Control from Running in Internet Explorer Remove all trusted software publishers To prevent controls from being downloaded and executed without warnings, all trusted publishers should be removed from your Internet Explorer configuration. We should say how to do this. Wait for the new technology from Microsoft Implicitly, this appears to be the solution adopted by Microsoft and Apple on these vulnerabilities. If your organization can accept the risk in the meantime, the new technology should provide a low cost, reliable way to prevent the vulnerable controls from being executed. Leftovers With some controls, this solution may prevent other applications from functioning properly. It is not know at this time if this presents a security risk, but even if it does, the exposure is likely to be limited to attackers with local access to the system.",
