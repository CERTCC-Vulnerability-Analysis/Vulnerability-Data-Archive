  "Impact": "An attacker who is able to send DNS responses to a vulnerable system could cause a denial of service, crashing the application that made calls to a vulnerable resolver library. It does not appear that this vulnerability can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code. There may be some risk of information disclosure if a vulnerable system returns the contents of memory adjacent to a DNS response.",

In the case of statically linked binaries, it is necessary to recompile using the patched version of the DNS stub resolver libraries. ISC has provided the following guidance for applications that call DNS resolution functions directly: For application writers. Use a maximum sized buffer (64k), be prepared to redo the calls res_search(), res_query(), res_send(), res_nsearch(), res_nquery() and res_send() with a bigger buffer or take the minimum of the answer buffer size and the value returned by these calls and be aware that the answer is truncated.",
