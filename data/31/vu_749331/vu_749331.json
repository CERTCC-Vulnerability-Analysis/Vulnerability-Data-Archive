  "Workarounds": "According to the Cisco Advisory a workaround for this vulnerability is as follows: The workaround is to filter DHCP requests. This task must be executed while in enable mode. To filter DHCP packets use this procedure: cbos# set filter 0 on allow incoming eth0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 protocol udp srcport 68-68 destport 67-67\ncbos#set filter 1 on allow outgoing eth0 1.2.3.4 255.255.255.255 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 protocol udp srcport 67-67 destport 68-68 The filter \"0\" will allow all DHCP requests from your internal network to the CPE. The filter \"1\" will allow all DHCP responses from the CPE. In this example, the eth0 interface of the CPE has the IP address of 1.2.3.4. You must substitute this address with the IP address of your eth0 port. This configuration is not the complete workaround since you are still exposed from you LAN side (behind the eth0 interface). Note: There is an implicit \"deny all\" as the last filter so you must include additional \"permit\" filters to allow a normal traffic flow. If you already have filters configured, you should combine this example with the configured filters and probably change the filter numbers to suit your configuration. Also note that this workaround is not applicable if you must have DHCP enabled on the WAN side. For information regarding filters, refer to: http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/dsl_prod/c600s/cbos/cbos240/03chap02.htm#xtocid365615.",
