The steps below can be used to disable the rpc.espd daemon to prevent \nexploitation of this vulnerability until patches can be installed. 1) Become the root user on the system. % /bin/su -\n                Password: 2) Change the permissions on the rpc.espd daemon. # /bin/chmod -x /usr/etc/rpc.espd 3) Restart inetd to kill any vulnerable running daemons. # /etc/killall -HUP inetd 4) Return to previous level. # exit",
