  "Workarounds": "Modify IE settings It is possible to significantly limit the ability of IE to automatically load MIDI files from HTML documents by making all of the following modifications: Disable Active scripting\nDisable Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins (stops <EMBED src=x.mid>)\nDisable Play sounds in web pages (stops <BGSOUND src=x.mid>)\nDisable Play videos in web pages (stops <IMG dynsrc=x.mid>)\nThe only complete solution for these vulnerabilities is to apply the patch. For example, Outlook Express 6 SP1 will play a MIDI file in an HTML email message regardless of the settings for audio and video in web pages. There may be other methods to automatically load a MIDI file from an HTML document. Also, these modifications will prevent some web pages from functioning properly.",
