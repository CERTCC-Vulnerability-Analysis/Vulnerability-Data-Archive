  "Description": "CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow - CVE-2016-2342 Quagga is a software routing suite that implements numerous routing protocols for Unix-based platforms. A memcpy function in the VPNv4 NLRI parser of bgp_mplsvpn.c does not properly check the upper-bound length of received Labeled-VPN SAFI routes data, which may allow for arbitrary code execution on the stack. Note that hosts are only vulnerable if bgpd is running with BGP peers enabled for VPNv4, which is not a default configuration. For more details, refer to the Quagga changelog and commit notes.",
