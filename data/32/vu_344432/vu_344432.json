  "Description": "CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials - CVE-2016-2343 According to the researcher, Eaglesoft uses hard-coded credentials to access a database back-end. The credentials are the same across installations of Eaglesoft. Sensitive patient information is contained in Eaglesoft databases. An administrator is unable to change these credentials without breaking access to the back-end database. The researcher has published a blog post with more information.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict Network Access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from using the hard-coded credentials from a blocked network location. Do not allow the Eaglesoft database to be accessed by unauthorized users on an insecure wireless network. If the Eaglesoft database is accessible from an insecure wireless network, a remote attacker may be able to gain access using the hard-coded credentials. Wireless access points should be configured to use WPA2 encryption and disable the WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) PIN. Encryption standards such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) can be easily cracked and should not be relied on to secure wireless networks.",
