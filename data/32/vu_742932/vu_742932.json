  "Description": "CWE-592: Authentication Bypass Issues\nRuckus Wireless Zoneflex 2942 Wireless Access Point version 9.6.0.0.267 contains an authentication bypass vulnerability. A local unauthenticated attacker may attempt to login with any credentials and after receiving the authentication failure message, the user can remove the /login.asp portion of the URI to bypass the login page. The attacker will not be able to browse to the other configuration pages of the device via the graphical user interface, but they can then manually edit the URI to gain access to the following pages: /configuration/wireless.asp\n/configuration/local_network.asp\n/configuration/internet.asp\n/configuration/device.asp\n/maintenance/upgrade.asp\n/maintenance/reboot.asp",
