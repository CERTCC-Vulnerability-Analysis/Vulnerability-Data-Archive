  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a KDC server. This could allow an attacker to gain the master secret for a Kerberos realm, leading to compromise of the entire realm. An attacker who is able to impersonate a KDC or application server may be able to execute arbitrary code on Kerberos clients. An attacker may also be able to crash a KDC or client, causing a denial of service.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access Depending on network architecture, it may be practical to restrict access to KDC servers (88/udp) from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Due to network application requirements, it may be possible, but less practical, to limit access from Kerberos clients to trusted KDC and application servers. While these workarounds will help to limit the source of attacks, they will not prevent attacks from trusted hosts or networks or attackers who can successfully spoof their source addresses.",

  "Overview": "The MIT Kerberos 5 library does not securely deallocate heap memory when decoding ASN.1 structures, resulting in double-free vulnerabilities. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a KDC server, which could compromise an entire Kerberos realm. An attacker may also be able to execute arbitrary code on Kerberos clients, or cause a denial of service on KDCs or clients.",
