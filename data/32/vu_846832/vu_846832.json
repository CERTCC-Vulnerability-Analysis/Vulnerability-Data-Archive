  "Impact": "An attacker can pass multiple occurrences of a sensitive environment variable (such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_PRELOAD, etc.) to a setuid root program. Even if glibc forces that program to ignore these variables, they may be passed along to a program called from the setuid root program. Using this indirect execution, an attacker might cause malicious code to be executed as root.",
