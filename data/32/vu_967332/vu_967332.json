  "Description": "According to Qualys, the vulnerability is \"a buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots() function of the GNU C Library (glibc). This bug is reachable both locally and remotely via the gethostbyname*() functions\" and furthermore, \"arbitrary code execution can be achieved\" by use of the buffer overflow. All versions of glibc from glibc-2.2 (released 2010-11-10) until glibc-2.17 are vulnerable. The vulnerability was patched on 2013-05-21, prior to the release of glibc-2.18. For more details, please see the full Qualys Security Advisory.",
