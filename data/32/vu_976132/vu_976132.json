  "Impact": "An authenticated local attacker may be able to bypass Secure Boot and/or perform an arbitrary reflash of the platform firmware despite the presence of signed firmware update enforcement. Additionally, the attacker could arbitrarily read or write to the SMRAM region. Lastly, the attacker could corrupt the platform firmware and cause the system to become inoperable.",

  "Description": "According to Rafal Wojtczuk of Bromium and Corey Kallenberg of The MITRE Corporation: \"During the UEFI S3 Resume path, a boot script is interpreted to re-initialize the platform. The boot script dictates various memory and port read/write operations to facilitate this re-initialization. The boot script is interpreted early enough where important platform security mechanisms have not yet been configured. For example, BIOS_CNTL, which helps protects the platform firmware against arbitrary writes, is unlocked. TSEGMB, which protects SMRAM against DMA, is also unlocked. Given this, the boot script is in a security critical position and maintaining its integrity is important. However, we have discovered that on certain systems the boot script resides in unprotected memory which can be tampered with by an attacker with access to physical memory.\"",
