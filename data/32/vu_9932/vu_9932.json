  "Description": "The SUNWlicsw Package is SUN Microsystems distribution of the FlexLM\nLicense System software.  It is used for the management of software\nlicenses for a number of SUN software products, and is generally installed\nat the same time as these products.\n\nDuring the installation of the SUNWlicsw package, a number of files are\nadded, including the system initialization script /etc/rc2.d/S85lmgrd.\nThis script starts the license manager daemon, and appends the logs from\nthis daemon to a log file.  By default, the log file is /tmp/license_log\nwhich has world writable permissions.  As this file is world writable\nand is opened in an insecure fashion in an insecure directory, it may be\npossible to create, or append data to, arbitrary files on the system.",

Once applied, the logs will be placed in the file\n/var/log/license_log.  To apply the patch, the patch file in Appendix A\nshould be saved to a file and run with the command:\n\n/usr/bin/patch /etc/rc2.d/S85lmgrd < {saved patch file}\n\nOnce the initialisation script /etc/rc2.d/S85lmgrd has been patched, the\nlicense manager daemon must be killed and re-started.  If the old logs\nare to be kept, they must be copied to /var/log/license_log (if that is\nwhat you have set $LOG_FILE to in /etc/rc2.d/S85lmgrd) before re-starting\nthe license manager daemon.  If the old logs are moved into a secure\ndirectory, ensure that their permissions are set to 600.",
