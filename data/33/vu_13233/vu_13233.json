  "Description": "A bug was found in the union file system code which can allow an\nunprivileged local user to compromise system stability.  This\nproblem is present in all source code and binary distributions of\nFreeBSD version 2.x released before 1996-05-18.\n\nThe union filesystem code had problems with certain mount ordering\nproblems.  By executing a certain sequence of mount_union commands,\nan unprivileged local user may cause a system reload.",
