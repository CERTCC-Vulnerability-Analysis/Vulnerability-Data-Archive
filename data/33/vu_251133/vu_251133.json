  "Description": "S2 NetBox is a line of \"...open architecture, scalable, IP network-ready products for the physical security industry that integrate access control, alarm monitoring, video surveillance, and temperature monitoring.\" S2 Netbox systems are operated entirely via a web interface. The Netbox web server does not properly authenticate access to several directories, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to access network node logs, employee photographs, and backup archives. Linear (formerly IEI) eMerge is based on S2 Netbox, and Sonitrol eAccess is based on Linear eMerge. eMerge and eAccess may also be affected by this vulnerability.",
