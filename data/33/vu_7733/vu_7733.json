  "Description": "There is a vulnerability in some versions of the University of\nWashington's implementation of the Internet Message Access Protocol\n(IMAP) and Post Office Protocol (POP). Information about this\nvulnerability has been publicly distributed.\n\n\nSNI posting\n\nThe vulnerable mail servers call a library routine to affect a Unix\n\"login\", authenticating the user against it's password. A stack overrun\nexists in this routine. In essence this will allow any client with the ability\nto attempt a login to enter an overly long username to cause arbitrary machine\ncode to execute.\n\nBoth the POP and IMAP servers Mr. Crispin distributes discard supervisory\nprivileges sometime after this authentication phase. Unfortunately, the\noverflow occurs before this happens, and the vulnerability will thus\nallow an attacker superuser access.\n\nThe problematic routine is server_login(), which is in \"log_xxx.c\" in the\nOS-dependent code tree of the server source distribution. The problem\noccurs due to the routine's attempt to allow a case insensitive match on\nthe username, which it does by copying the username provided to the\nroutine into an automatic variable in the routine's stack.\n\nThe username buffer is MAILTMPLEN long, which defaults to 1024 bytes.\nUnfortunately, the server's input buffer is greater than this, allowing a\nremote client to feed the routine a username greater than 1024 bytes.\nIf the excess characters in this username contain a valid virtual memory\naddress, the routine will overwrite it's stack frame when copying the\nusername, causing the return from the routine to jump to an unexpected\nlocation.\n\nInterestingly, the buffer is converted to lowercase after being copied.\nThis provides a slight technical challenge, as the machine code required\nto take over the server contains uppercase characters. However,\nmodifications to the \"standard\" stack overrun exploit code to reverse the\naffects of this lowercasing were trivial. On i386 4.4BSD, the VM address\nrequired to redirect server_login()'s return need not contain uppercase\ncharacters.",
