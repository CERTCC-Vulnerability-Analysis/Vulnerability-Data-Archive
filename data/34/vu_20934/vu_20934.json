  "Description": "From the CIsco advisory: \n\nSummary\n=======\nAn error in Cisco IOS software makes it possible for untrusted,\nunauthenticated users who can gain access to the login prompt of a router or\nother Cisco IOS device, via any means, to obtain fragments of text entered\nby prior interactive users of the device.  This text may contain sensitive\ninformation, possibly including passwords. This vulnerability exposes only\ntext entered at prompts issued by  the IOS device itself; the contents of\ndata packets forwarded by IOS devices are not exposed, nor are data entered\nas part of outgoing interactive connections, such as TELNET connections,\nfrom the IOS device to other network nodes.",
