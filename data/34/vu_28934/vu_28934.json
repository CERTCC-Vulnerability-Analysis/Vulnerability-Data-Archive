  "Resolution": "From  Sun Security Bulletin #00191: Sun announces the release of patches for Solaris(tm) 7, 2.6, 2.5.1,\n    2.5, 2.4, and 2.3 (SunOS(tm) 5.7, 5.6, 5.5.1, 5.5, 5.4 and 5.3), which\n    relate to a vulnerability with sadmind. Sun recommends that you install the patches listed in section 4\n    immediately on systems running SunOS 5.7, 5.6, 5.5.1, and 5.5 and\n    on systems with Solstice AdminSuite (AdminSuite) installed. If you have\n    installed a version of AdminSuite prior to version 2.3, please upgrade\n    to AdminSuite 2.3 before installing the AdminSuite patches listed in\n    section 4. Sun also recommends that you: - disable sadmind if you do not use it by commenting the\n      following line in /etc/inetd.conf: 100232/10 tli rpc/udp wait root /usr/sbin/sadmind sadmind - set the security level used to authenticate requests to STRONG\n      as follows, if you use sadmind: 100232/10 tli rpc/udp wait root /usr/sbin/sadmind sadmind -S 2 The above changes to /etc/inetd.conf will take effect after inetd\n      receives a hang-up signal.",
