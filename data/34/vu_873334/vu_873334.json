  "Workarounds": "Check Point workarounds The Check Point ISAKMP Alert provides the following advice for customers who are unable to upgrade: Customers using affected releases, who are not able to upgrade at this time, can confirm that they are not affected by running \"fw checklic encryption\" for a false return. Customers using affected releases, who have a VPN encryption license should disable the VPN encryption and confirm that there are no Objects with ISAKMP checked. Customers who are running an earlier version of VPN-1/FireWall-1 4.1 SP5a and prior, and cannot upgrade should contact Check Point Technical Services for assistance. Block or Restrict Access Block or restrict access to the ISAKMP service (500/udp) from untrusted networks such as the Internet. This will disable IKE and ISAKMP functionality (authentication, key exchange, SA negotiation) which is likely to disable most VPN services. Depending on service requirements, it may be possible to operate VPN connections without IKE/ISAKMP by using static SAs and pre-shared keys. Note also that in most cases it is trivial for an attacker to spoof the source of a UDP packet.",
