  "Workarounds": "Ref: [OpenMail Technical Guide, pages 3-366, and 3-369] Hewlett-Packard notes that this issue has already been adequately\naddressed in OpenMail. There is a general parameter setting\n(UAL_PRINT_SERVER_ONLY) in the general.cfg file, that, if set to TRUE,\nforces all server printing to go through OpenMail's print server. The  general customization file general.cfg is located in\n/var/opt/openmail/sys, as is the print server's configuration file\nprint.cfg. On the client all that is necessary is to then change the\n'Printer Server Command' to point to one of the configured printers. OpenMail's print server uses a configuration file to configure available\nprinters, and validates each print request against its configured\nprinters. Any print requests that do not match the required syntax will\nnot be executed. More information about OpenMail's print server and how to configure it\ncan be found in the OpenMail Technical Guide (pages 3-366 to 3-369 for\nthe GR5 edition)",
