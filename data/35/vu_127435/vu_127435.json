  "Impact": "By creating symbolic links named for either of the two temporary files, an intruder can overwrite any file in the system with data from kmmodreg. Since kmmodreg runs automatically during reboot, no separate invocation is required. The overwrite may cause a file corruption leading to denial of service, or, since the temporary files are created to allow modification by anyone (protected 666), this may be used to allow modification of system files leading to increased user privileges.",
