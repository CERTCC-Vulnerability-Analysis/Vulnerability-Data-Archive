  "Workarounds": "> One quick workaround for this is to change the \"start\" script used to\n> start up the servers to check for symlinks in the logs directory; > I've enclosed a sample modified \"start\" script and a simple program\n> used by that script to check the modes of the log files. This is\n> probably good enough for the case where ns-httpd is started\n> automatically, but A better solution (that would prevent a race\n> condition from happening when someone restarts ns-httpd on a running\n> system) would be for the server itself to do an lstat of each log file\n> to make sure it's not a symlink or hard link before chowning it. > (Even better would be to do an open, then an lstat of the pathname of\n> the file just opened, then an fstat of the file descriptor just\n> opened, and compare the dev and inode of the fstat and lstat results\n> as well as checking the link count before chowning file). > Another easy workaround might be to configure the server to use syslog\n> rather than writing to its own log files.",
