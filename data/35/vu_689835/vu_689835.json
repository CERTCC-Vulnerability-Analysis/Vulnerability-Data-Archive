  "Impact": "There are two classes of end-users affected by this report: [<h4>Consumers of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader Products</h4>] Attackers that can convince users to download and install malicious programs (non-certified plug-ins) may be able to execute arbitrary code on the user's system. Executing arbitrary code may allow an attacker to display false information when reporting document information and circumvent digital rights management features that prevent printing, copying of text, etc. This can only happen via non-certified plug-ins installed in a plug_ins directory when the 'Use Only Certified Plug-ins' checkbox is turned off, the default state in Adobe Acrobat 6.0 and Adobe Reader 6.0. [<h4>Digital Content Providers</h4>] Digital content providers can not rely on plug-in cryptographic verification mechanisms to prevent attackers from gaining certain rights. These rights include printing, copying of text, and other digital-rights-management features when the attacker is able to access legitimately decrypted documents and the attacker has control of the local system. Note this can happen regardless of the plug-in architecture used. The ability for any application to protect such rights is dependent on the underlying operating system architecture, not application architecture.",

  "Workarounds": "[<h3>Workarounds</h3>] There are two classes of end-user response to this report: [<h4>Consumers of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader Products</h4>] Be careful not to install untrusted software, including non-certified Adobe plug-ins (those not signed and deployed by Adobe), unless absolutely certain of the origin and integrity of such software. Unverified non-certified plug-ins can be removed from the plug-ins directory, and they will no longer load at startup. If you desire additional protection, you may wish to set the certified-plug-ins-only feature. When the 'Use Only Certified Plug-ins' checkbox under 'Edit->Preferences->Startup' (under 'Application Startup') is enabled (not the default), non-certified plug-ins are prevented from loading at startup. Finally, to prevent all plug-ins from loading when an Acrobat viewer starts, press the 'Shift' key while the application is starting. [<h4>Digital Content Providers</h4>] Do not rely on any digital rights management features enforced solely via non-certified plug-ins for critical content. When appropriate, use the stronger document signature and encryption features built into the Adobe Acrobat products.",

  "Overview": "By default, Adobe PDF viewers will start up and load non-certified plug-ins installed in a local plug_ins directory. Adobe Reader plug-ins not certified by Adobe, if allowed to load, will execute arbitrary code in the process space of the running viewer. One incremental impact of such arbitrary code execution is to put the viewer into 'Certified Mode', allowing the circumvention of certain digital right management features such as  printing, copying of text, etc.",
