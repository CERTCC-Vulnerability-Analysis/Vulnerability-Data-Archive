  "Description": "The HyperSQL Database Engine version 1.8.1.3, and possibly earlier versions, allows an authenticated attacker to create 'text tables' that allow reading and writing of text files to the filesystem. According to Hsqldb User Guide Chapter 6 - Text Tables: \"File locations are restricted to below the directory that contains the database, unless the textdb.allow_full_path property is set true in the database properties file.\" The database properties file is a text file and located in the same directory as the database. The database properties file may be loaded as a source for a text table and modified to include textdb.allow_full_path=true with SQL statements. An unauthenticated attacker cannot restart the database to enable this feature but they may shut down the database and wait for a sysadmin or cron job to restart it. Upon a restart the textdb.allow_full_path property will be enabled. At this point an unauthenticated attacker may be able to read or write to arbitrary files on the server.",

  "CVSS_SecurityRequirementsAR": "ND", 
  "Resolution": "We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. HyperSQL 2.2.8 is not affected by this vulnerability because the textdb.allow_full_path must be a JAVA environment variable.",
