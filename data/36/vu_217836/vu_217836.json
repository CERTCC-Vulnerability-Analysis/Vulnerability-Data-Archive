  "Description": "The ERAS 2.8.4 and 2.9.5 Help Desk application has been reported to contain vulnerabilities to blind SQL injection as well as command execution on the target server. The vulnerability requires that the attacker be authenticated in the application. CWE-79 - Blind SQL Injection - CVE-2013-3577\nA blind SQL injection attack may be performed against the ct100$4MainController$TextBoxSearchValue parameter or search box. CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') - CVE-2013-3578\nA stacked query based SQL attack on the ct100$4MainController$TextBoxSearchValue parameter or search box allows for a remote authenticated attacker to execute commands on the server. The CVSS scores below apply to CVE-2013-3578.",
