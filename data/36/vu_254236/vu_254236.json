  "Workarounds": "Block traffic to and from common Microsoft RPC ports As an interim measure, users can reduce the chance of successful exploitation by blocking traffic to and from well-known Microsoft RPC ports, including Port 135 (tcp/udp)\nPort 137 (udp)\nPort 138 (udp)\nPort 139 (tcp)\nPort 445 (tcp/udp)\nPort 593 (tcp) To prevent compromised hosts from contacting other vulnerable hosts, the CERT/CC recommends that system administrators filter the ports listed above for both incoming and outgoing traffic. Disable COM Internet Services and RPC over HTTP COM Internet Services (CIS) is an optional component that allows RPC messages to be tunneled over HTTP ports 80 and 443. As an interim measure, sites that use CIS may wish to disable it as an alternative to blocking traffic to and from ports 80 and 443.
