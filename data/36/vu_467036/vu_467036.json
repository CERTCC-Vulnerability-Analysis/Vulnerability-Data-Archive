See Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-044 for instructions. Install the Outlook Email Security Upgrade. View messages in plain text. Many email programs have facilities for setting preferences to view messages as plain text or to render them as HTML documents. Disable scripting when viewing untrusted web pages. These measures do not eliminate the vulnerability, but significantly reduce your exposure to it.",
