  "Description": "(From SNI) During testing of our upcoming network auditing tool I discovered a\nproblem present in NCSA httpd 1.5c, which causes a buffer overflow.\nAfter debugging, it is evident that sending long URL's to the\nserver results in an overflow, and stack corruption.\n\nBased on a gdb session, and on source inspection, the problem\nappears to be virtually identical to the NCSA httpd 1.3 buffer\noverflow.  A MAX_STRING_LEN is used where a HUGE_STRING_LEN should\nbe on a non-boundry-checking string function, in this case strcat.\nAttached are context diffs against the NCSA httpd 1.5c http_send.c\nfile, which appear to fix the problem of filenames longer than 255\ncharacters causing an overflow.  The fix is not perfect; it is a\nkludge, and could stand some improving, but it does work if\nsomebody wants to release an advisory right away.\n\nSome further investigation, by sending exceedingly long filenames,\nin particular ones slightly shorter than 8192 bytes also cause NCSA\nhttpd 1.5c to seg fault.  This would indicate that there still\nremains at least one buffer overflow in the server.\n\nThe contents of this message are Copyright 1996, Secure Networks\nInc.  and may be reproduced in whole or in part provided that the\nmaterial is attributed to myself and Secure Networks Inc.",
