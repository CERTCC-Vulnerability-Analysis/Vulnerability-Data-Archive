  "Description": "I received a free developer copy of BSD/OS, which I used to set up\na new system in the past few days. Here's the signature:\n\nBSD/OS spike.porcupine.org 2.1 BSDI BSD/OS 2.1 Kernel #2: Sat\nNov 30 10:37:06 EST 1996\n\nWhile setting up the FTP account I noticed an error in the FTPD\nmanual page, with possible security implications. Quote follows:\n\n.....  In order that system security is not  breached,  it\nis  recommended  that  the  ``ftp'' subtree be constructed\nwith care;  the following rules are recommended.\n\n~ftp)  Make  the  home  directory  owned  by  ``ftp''  and\nunwritable by anyone.\n\nWith this setup, the ftpd as shipped by BSDI will allow remote\nanonymous users to change the permissions of the FTP root directory\nand to ship trojan horses into the system:\n\nftp> site chmod 777 .\n200 CHMOD command successful.\n\nThe result is a world-writable directory. Many avenues of attack\nare now possible: plant a .forward file with shell command;\n\nftp> put myforward .forward\nlocal: myforward remote: .forward\n200 PORT command successful.\n150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for .forward.\n226 Transfer complete.\n\nAnother attack: rename the bin directory and upload the attacker's\nversion of any programs or files used by ftpd:\n\nftp> rename bin bar\n350 File exists, ready for destination name\n250 RNTO command successful.\n\nOr rename any other directory and install trojanized versions of\nthe original files so that customers are lured into making their\nsystems insecure.",

Or words to that effect. In fact, there is no need for any file or\ndirectory to be owned by the ``ftp'' account, as such files can be\nremotely tampered with by anonymous users.",
