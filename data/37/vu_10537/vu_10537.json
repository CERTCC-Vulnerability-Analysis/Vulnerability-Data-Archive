  "Description": "Any 4.1.x customers who are currently running an FCS\n(unpatched) sendmail may need to change sendmail configuration\nfiles on \"subsidiary\" systems when installing 100377-08. This\nis because the interpretation of the \"%y\" operator underwent a\nsmall undocumented change in sendmail patch 100377-04.\n\nIn addition, those 4.1.x customers who implemented workarounds\nin response to that change---which many did not encounter until\nthey installed the highly publicized 100377-07--may wish to\nadapt the configuration files to use the new \"%l\" operator.\nHowever, any configuration file which worked correctly under\n100377-07 will continue to work under -08.\n\nNo configuration file changes are needed on Solaris 2.x\nsystems.",
