  "Description": "I made a long hostname here, and put it into the netgroup file.  We use\nnetgroups to control (among other things) who can rsh/rlogin to our\nhosts via an the hosts.equiv file.  The long hostname, 24 characters,\ncaused a security hole.  Any remote user could rsh/rlogin to any valid\naccount on our machines without a password.\n\nWe are running SunOS4.1.4 with standard NIS (not NIS+ and not Solaris).\n\nFollow-on  mail provided these further details:\n\nWe have a script that generates our netgroup file.  For some reason it\nmade this entry in /etc/netgroups:\n \nchocobo   (,-,#sitename removed#\n \nThe chocobo netgroup is an entry in tcclinuxtest, which is a member of\ntcclinux, which is a member of tccpc.  We have +@tccpc in the\n/etc/hosts.equiv for all of our UNIX boxes.  Whenever someone would\nrlogin via a terminal server or SLIP connection, it would not ask for a\npassword.  You can access any account this way.\n \nWe run NIS, not NIS+.  Our master yp server is a \"SunOS prism 4.1.3 9\nsun4c\" (from uname -a).  The client machines run SunOS 4.1.4, not\n4.1.3.\n\n\n",
