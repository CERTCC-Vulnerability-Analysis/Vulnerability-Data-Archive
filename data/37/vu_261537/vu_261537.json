  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause the RPC Endpoint Mapper to terminate, denying service to legitimate users. Since the RPC Endpoint Mapper is part of the RPC service, \"...exploiting this vulnerability would cause the RPC service to fail, with the attendant loss of any RPC-based services the server offers, as well as potential loss of some COM functions.\"\nOnce the RPC service has been terminated, an attacker may be able to take control over an orphaned named pipe and gain the privileges of the RPC service (Local System).",
