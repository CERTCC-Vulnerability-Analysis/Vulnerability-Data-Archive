  "Description": "Description of the problem in all versions of\nCalendar Manager preceeding version V4.0-10\n\n. Calendar Manager's startup procedure installs images with enhanced\nprivileges. Installing images with privileges is a frequently used\nway to share information between users in a VMS environment.\n. A method that exploits these installed images in an unintended\nmanner has been discovered, giving rise to security problems.\n. removing privileges from the installed images seriously restricts\nthe functionality of the software.",
