  "Impact": "Depending on configuration, operating system, and platform architecture, a remote attacker with anonymous read-only access to a vulnerable CVS server could execute arbitrary code, read sensitive information, or cause a denial of service. There is a significant secondary impact in that source code maintained in CVS repositories could be modified to include trojan horses, backdoors, or other malicious code.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable CVS Server Until patches are available and can be applied, consider disabling the CVS server. Disable Anonymous CVS Access Disable anonymous access to the CVS server. Block or Restrict Access Block or restrict access to the CVS server from untrusted hosts and networks. The CVS server typically listens on 2401/tcp, but may use another port or protocol. Limit CVS Server Privileges Configure CVS server to run in a restricted (chroot) environment. Run CVS servers with the minimum set of privileges required on the host file system. Provide separate systems for development (write) and public/anonymous (read-only) CVS access. Host public/anonymous CVS servers on single-purpose, secured systems. Note that none of these workarounds will prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. These workarounds will only limit the scope and impact of possible attacks. Other features inherent in CVS may give anonymous users the ability to gain shell access.",
