  "Impact": "An attacker can construct a message with a crafted From: header that will cause Pine to crash with a segmentation fault, possibly resulting in a core dump. Pine users may be unable to restart the application if messages containing the crafted From: headers appear in mailboxes that Pine is configured to check at startup. Additionally, it may be possible for intruders to execute code on the heap of systems using vulnerable versions of the software. The code would be executed in the context of the user running the Pine program.",
