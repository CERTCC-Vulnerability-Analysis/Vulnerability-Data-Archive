  "Workarounds": "According to the @stake report, it is possible to remove world writeable attributes from the folders. This may however break functionality of some applications. From the draft advisory by @stake: @stake recommends the following options: 1) Review the file and directory permissions in the following\ndirectories: /Applications, /Library/Application Support and\n/Library/StartupItems. While it may make sense to remove global write permissions on all\ndirectories in /Applications, this may break the functionality of\ncertain applications. To attempt this, execute the following command\nfrom within Terminal.app: find /Applications -type d -exec chmod o-w {} \\; Warning: this command may break certain applications. 2) Apply the latest patches from Apple. 3) When installing applications, use the UNIX cp(1) command.",
