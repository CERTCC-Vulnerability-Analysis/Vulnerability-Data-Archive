  "Description": "There appears to be three separate problems in the l0pht advisory.\n\nl0pht writes --\n\nThe first problem is that database default ACLs are set to give every user\n(including anonymous) 'designer' access (practically total control), as\nwell as defaults the 'Max Internet Access' setting to 'editor'.\n\nBill Fithen writes --\n\nThe initial ACL they claim is assigned to a new database does not match\nwhat I saw at all\n\nI do agree with their statement that the \"Max Internet Access\" is set to\n\"editor\" by default, which is in my opinion too high; it should be\n\"reader\".\n\nl0pht writes --\n\nThe second problem is that databases do not correctly inherit the access\ncontrol list from their parent template.\n\nBill Writes --\n\nThe Lotus documentation plainly states that ACLs are not and should not\nbe inherited from templates.\n\nl0pht writes --\n\nThe third problem is that there is no included software that allows an\nadmin to 'test' the security of their server and the server's configuration\nfiles.\n\nLotues Writes --\n\n-The next feature release of Domino will take further steps to address\nsite-wide ACL management.",
