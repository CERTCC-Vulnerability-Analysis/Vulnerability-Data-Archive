  "Impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, execute commands, read sensitive information, or cause a denial of service. Any client with the ability to create entry lines could exploit this vulnerability. It is possible for an anonymous user with read-only access to exploit this vulnerability against a vulnerable server. In addition to compromising the system running CVS, there is a significant secondary impact in that source code maintained in CVS repositories could be modified to include trojan horses, backdoors, or other malicious code.",

Block or restrict access Block or restrict access to the CVS server from untrusted hosts and networks. The CVS server typically listens on 2401/tcp, but it may use another port or protocol. Limit the CVS server privileges\nConfigure CVS server to run in a restricted (chroot) environment. Run CVS servers with the minimum set of privileges required on the host file system. Provide separate systems for development (write) and public/anonymous (read-only) CVS access. Host public/anonymous CVS servers on single-purpose, secured systems.
