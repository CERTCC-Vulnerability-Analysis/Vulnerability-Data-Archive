  "Workarounds": "Enable MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS TE) Cisco strongly encourages that you upgrade to an unaffected version of the code. As a short term solution to mitigate against this vulnerability, Cisco recommends enabling MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS TE) globally. To apply this workaround, Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) needs to be enabled on the device to enable MPLS TE. CEF and MPLS TE can be enabled by the following commands. Router(config)# ip cef\nRouter(config)# mpls traffic-eng tunnels Having MPLS TE enabled will make the router immune to the attacks  coming from any interface.",
