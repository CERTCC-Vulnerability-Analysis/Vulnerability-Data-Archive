  "Description": "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') TVT TD-2308SS-B DVR and possibly other models running firmware version 3.2.0.P-3520A-00 contain a directory traversal vulnerability. An attacker can use directory traversal to download critical files such as the config.dat file for the device which contains the credentials for the web interface. For example: http://[IP ADDRESS]/../../../mnt/mtd/config/config.dat This file can be parsed with the strings command to reveal the administrative user's plaintext credentials.",
