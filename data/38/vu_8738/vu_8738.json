  "Workarounds": "This problem can be alleviated by removing the set-user-id bit from the\n\"lquerypv\" program. To do this, execute the following command as \"root\": chmod u-s /usr/sbin/lquerypv Note that this action will cause some Logical Volume Manager commands to\nfail when they are executed by non-\"root\" users (such as \"lsps\"). It will\nnot affect the operation of these commands when they are executed by\n\"root\". IBM has released offical fixes for the vulnerability AIX 3.2.x Not vulnerable; no fix necessary. AIX 4.1.x APAR - IX64203 To determine if you have this APAR on your system, run the following\ncommand: instfix -ik IX64203\nOr, run this command: lslpp -h bos.rte.lvm and verify that your version of bos.rte.lvm is 4.1.5.3 or later. AIX 4.2.x APAR - IX64204 To determine if you have this APAR on your system, run the following\ncommand: instfix -ik IX64204 Or, run this command: lslpp -h bos.rte.lvm and verify that your version of bos.rte.lvm is 4.2.0.7 or later.",
