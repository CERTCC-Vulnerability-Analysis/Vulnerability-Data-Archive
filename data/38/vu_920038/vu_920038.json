  "Workarounds": "Apply an Update Firmware updates will be posted to the Dell support page when available. Users should download the appropriate update for the version of iDRAC they have installed: iDRAC6 \u201cmonolithic\u201d (rack and towers) \u2013 FW version 1.96; targeted release date is Q4CY13. iDRAC7 all models \u2013 FW version 1.46.45; target release date is mid/late September 2013. NOTE: iDRAC6 \u201cmodular\u201d (blades) are not affected; no updates are required. Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the Dell iDRAC web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location.",
