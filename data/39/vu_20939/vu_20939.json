  "Workarounds": "There are all kinds of workarounds depending on how fancy they want\nto get (e.g. they could parse the tar file and change the stored uids\non the fly). But a simple one might be to have a chown.nosym program\nthat only does the chown if the file is not a symbolic link. Actually, I think there are other difficulties anyway with the\nmethod they are using to transfer these files. What if a user simply had a hard link to someone else's file? Their chown -R would change that ownership as well, incorrectly. The \"chown -R\" is just too indescriminate. They could do a find on each user's home directory doing a chown\nonly on those files owned by the user (and skipping symbolic links): find ~$user \\! -type l -user $user -exec chown $newuser {} \\; (or for efficiency, do a -print instead to get a list of filenames\nto pass to fewer invocations of chown) This idea still fails where one user's directory contains a file\nowned by another user that does not appear in the other user's directory. (This can happen, for example, if you make a hard link to someone else's\nfile who later deletes his/her own link to the file.) If there aren't many instances of this, it might suffice to find them: find ~$user \\! -user $user -print and fix them manually. You really want to run just one find, changing all the uids to the\ncorrect value. You could write a (long) find script to do this,\nbut hard links are still a problem since you don't want to change\na file twice (for example, if uid 5 is changing to 7 and uid 7 is\nchanging to 5). The tar parser begins to look better and better...",
