  "Description": "A recent mailing list disclosure described two\nvulnerabilities in\nwhich HP Remote Watch allows unauthorized root access. The first was\nvia a socket connection on port 5556.  The second was as a result of\nusing the showdisk utility, which is part of the Remote Watch product.\nIt has been found that HP9000 Series 300, 400, 700, and 800 systems\nrunning only HP-UX Release 9.X have this vulnerability.",

  "Workarounds": "This vulnerability can only be eliminated from releases 9.X of HP-UX\nwhich are using Remote Watch by disabling the entire product. The\ndefault location for this product is /usr/remwatch/   . Removal can be accomplished (as root) with the following: NOTE: Do not run the standard rmfn command as HP has discovered\nproblems with its inability to handle programs with active executables. Instead, run (with no options): /usr/remwatch/bin/removeall This runs a Remote Watch script called \"unconfigure\" to stop actively\nrunning programs, then proceeds to remove all files including the\nfilesets. The administrator should also perform both of the following steps: 1. Remove or comment out the following entry in /etc/inetd.conf\nfile: rwdaemon stream tcp nowait root /usr/remwatch/bin/rwdaemon rwdaemon 2. Have inetd re-read its configuration file by executing at the\nprompt: inetd -c",
