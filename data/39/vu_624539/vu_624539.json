  "Description": "CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check - CVE-2016-6564 Android devices with code from Ragentek contain a privileged binary that performs over-the-air (OTA) update checks. Additionally, there are multiple techniques used to hide the execution of this binary. This behavior could be described as a rootkit. This binary, which resides as /system/bin/debugs, runs with root privileges and does not communicate over an encrypted channel. The binary has been shown to communicate with three hosts via HTTP: oyag[.]lhzbdvm[.]com\noyag[.]prugskh[.]net\noyag[.]prugskh[.]com Server responses to requests sent by the debugs binary include functionalities to execute arbitrary commands as root, install applications, or update configurations. Examples of a request sent by the client binary: POST /pagt/agent?data={\"name\":\"c_regist\",\"details\":{...}} HTTP/1. 1\nHost: 114.80.68.223\nConnection: Close An example response from the server could be: HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n{\"code\": \"01\", \"name\": \"push_commands\", \"details\": {\"server_id\": \"1\" ,\n\"title\": \"Test Command\", \"comments\": \"Test\", \"commands\": \"touch /tmp/test\"}} This binary is reported to be present in the following devices: BLU Studio G\nBLU Studio G Plus\nBLU Studio 6.0 HD\nBLU Studio X\nBLU Studio X Plus\nBLU Studio C HD\nInfinix Hot X507\nInfinix Hot 2 X510\nInfinix Zero X506\nInfinix Zero 2 X509\nDOOGEE Voyager 2 DG310\nLEAGOO Lead 5\nLEAGOO Lead 6\nLEAGOO Lead 3i\nLEAGOO Lead 2S\nLEAGOO Alfa 6\nIKU Colorful K45i\nBeeline Pro 2\nXOLO Cube 5.0",
