  "Description": "The problem involves AFP, the Appletalk Filing Protocol. Valid AFP response\npackets which do not contain the exact data which are requested by the\nclient can cause MacOS to crash and/or to corrupt memory and/or to\nterminate the connection to the server. Since AFP is transmitted directly\nor within IP packets over wide-area links, this is a potential attack.\n\nFile and directory information requests in AFP requests and replies\ntypically include a bitmask which describes which data fields are present.\nCurrent AFP clients require that the reply's bitmap is identical to the\nbitmap from the server.\n\nI have personally written an AFP server which tried to use a different\nreply bitmap. For instance, returning a file creation date from Unix hosts\ndoesn't make sense because UNix hosts typically don't have file creation\ndates. The results ranged from misinterpreted data through memory corrution\nto crashing clients.\n\nConclusion: (a) the AFP specification doesn't conform to the client\nimplementation, (b) reply packets which are altered in transit may crash\nthe client system.\nSince it is impossible to determine (without storing and analyzing the\noriginal request packet) whether the reply is a legal AFP packet (or\nrather, one which will be accepted by the client), this is a problem\nbeyond the apparently-well-known fact that (c) Apple's implementation of\nAppletalk does not seem to be resilient to various forms of \"broken\" data\npackets.",
