  "VendorStatement": "Immediate work-around is to remove the ssh-signer binary which is located in /opt/tectia/libexec/. Note that this will disable host-based authentication of the SSH Tectia Client. This has no adverse effect on SSH Tectia Server installation. You can also update your system to SSH Tectia client/server solution 5.2.4 or 5.3.6, which will fix the vulnerability. Once the update has been made, you can safely use the product again.",
