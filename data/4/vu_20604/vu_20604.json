  "Description": "In one of its tests, SATAN attempts to write to an anonymous FTP server's root\ndirectory.  This is done by attempting to FTP the UNIX file /etc/group to a\nserver and then deleting it.\n\nSome FTP servers have the ability to disable various FTP commands, one of\nwhich is DELE (file delete).  Others, such as WinQVT/Net v3.9 (a public\ndomain application for Windows), disables the DELE command altogether.  In\na situation in which ~ftp is writable and DELE is disabled, the net effect\nis that SATAN leaves a copy of the scanning system's /etc/group file on the\ntarget host and is unable to remove it.  This target host now has a copy of\na system file that could potentially have many (if not all) the usernames\nregistered on the host running SATAN.  In this manner, SATAN has\ncompromised the security of the local host.\n\nThe fix is trivial; have Satan attempt to transfer a non-sensitive file\ninstead of /etc/group.  The file to be transferred is specified on line 23\nof the file satan-1.1.1/bin/ftp.satan.  I understand that /etc/group was\nselected because it's universal to all UNIX systems, however, SATAN could\neasily create a file containing something to this effect:\n\nThis file was placed on your computer as a result of a scan by the SATAN\nnetwork security analysis tool from the network host x.y.z.  If you\nare reading this file, it means that there is a security problem with this\ncomputer, and you should contact [the appropriate people] as soon as possible.\n\nIf you require proof that I am who I claim to be, send mail to the Network\nOperations Center at NYU (noc@nyu.edu).\n\nFeel free to contact me if you require any further details, however, please\nconfirm receipt so that I know a person (and not a computer) has read this.\nThanks.\n\nSatan Group:\n\nIs there a mailing list that I can join to be kept up to date on Satan\ndevelopment?  Specifically, NYU would like to become a test site for new\nSatan releases or probes.  I apologize if something's already been\nadvertised on the newsgroups - we've been a bit busy here and it's been\ndifficult to keep up to date on some of this stuff.",
