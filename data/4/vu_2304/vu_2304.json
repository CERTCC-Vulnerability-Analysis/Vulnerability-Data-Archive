  "Impact": "Due to insufficient bounds checking on arguments which are supplied\nby users, it is possible to overwrite the internal stack space of the\npset program while it is executing. By supplying a carefully designed\nargument to the pset program, intruders may be able to force pset to\nexecute arbitrary commands. As pset is setgid sys, this may allow\nintruders to run arbitrary commands with the privileges of group sys. This may then be leveraged to gain root privileges.",
