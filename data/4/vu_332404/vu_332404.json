  "Workarounds": "Do not open untrusted Word documents Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Word or other Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip ST04-010. Do not rely on file name extension filtering In most cases, Windows will call Word to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if document.qwer contains the correct file header information, Windows will open document.qwer with Word. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .doc, and .dot) will not detect all Word documents. Disable automatic opening of Microsoft Office documents By default, Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Office 2000 will configure Internet Explorer to automatically open Microsoft Office documents. This feature can be disabled by using the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool. Mozilla Firefox users should disable automatic opening of files, as specified in the Securing Your Web Browser document. Open untrusted Word documents using the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) Office 2003 and 2007 users may wish to consider MOICE as a tool to securely preview untrusted Office documents. According to Microsoft: MOICE uses the 2007 Microsoft Office system converters to convert the Office binary format files into the Office Open XML format. This process helps remove the potential threat that may exist if the document is opened in the binary format. Additionally, MOICE converts incoming files in an isolated environment. This helps protect the computer from a potential threat. Instructions on how to install and configure MOICE are available in Microsoft KnowledgeBase article 935865 and Microsoft Security Advisory (937696).",
