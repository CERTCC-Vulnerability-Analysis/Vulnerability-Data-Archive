  "Impact": "By convincing a victim to view an HTML document (web page, HTML email, or email attachment), an attacker could download arbitrary files to a vulnerable system within the security context of the user running IE. These files could contain code that could be executed through other means. The user may click the file inadvertently, or the file may be placed in a sensitive location, such as the Windows Startup folder where it will automatically execute the next time the user logs onto the system. An attacker can also retrieve arbitrary files from a victim's computer.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable the wodSFTP control Disable the wodSFTP control by setting the kill bit as described in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 240797. The CLSID for the wodSFTP control is: {6795FA0F-35C3-4BEB-B3AA-F19DB0B228EA} This will prevent the wodSFTP control from being used in Internet Explorer but should not interfere with other applications that happen to use the control. Disable Active scripting and ActiveX Disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. With ActiveX controls disabled, the wodSFTP ActiveX control will not be instantiated. With Active scripting disabled, the wodSFTP ActiveX control cannot be scripted by a web site. Instructions for disabling Active scripting and ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the Securing Your Web Browser document and the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ.",
