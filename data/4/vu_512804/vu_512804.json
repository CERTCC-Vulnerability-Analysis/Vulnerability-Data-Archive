Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document.\u00a0 Disable the FileView object in Internet Explorer The Sky Software FileView ActiveX controls can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs. Note that this list is not a complete list of the vulnerable controls. Other versions of the FileView ActiveX control may use different CLSIDs. {0A7A7240-D038-DB9F-B3B1-7FEFFE5F9ED6} {247D857F-1034-4AA6-BB1A-347D1A3340C8} {551E5AC9-BDBD-48EC-8AE2-ECAF90C7A214} {A09AE68F-B14D-43ED-B713-BA413F034904} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797.
