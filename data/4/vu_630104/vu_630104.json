  "Impact": "By sending a specially crafted DHCP packet to an affected device, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause the device to stop processing incoming network traffic. Repeated exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a sustained denial-of-service condition. In order to regain functionality, the device must be rebooted to clear the input queue on the interface.",
