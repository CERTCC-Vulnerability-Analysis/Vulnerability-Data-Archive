  "Workarounds": "Disable snmpXdmi Sites that do not use both SNMP and DMI should disable the translation daemon, thus eliminating the vulnerability. Restrict Access to snmpXdmi and other RPC services Sites that require the functionality of snmpXdmi or other RPC services should restrict access through filtering. Local IP filtering rules that prevent hosts other than localhost from connecting to the daemon may mitigate the risks associated with running the daemon. Sun RPC services are advertised on port 111/{tcp,udp}. The snmpXdmid RPC service id is 100249; use 'rpcinfo -p' to list local site port bindings: # rpcinfo -p | grep 100249\n   100249 1 udp 32785 \n   100249 1 tcp 32786 Note that site-specific port binding will vary.",
