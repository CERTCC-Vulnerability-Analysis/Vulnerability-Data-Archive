  "Description": "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CVE-2016-5653 According to the reporter, an authenticated but low privileged user may exploit a SQL Injection in the \"ID\" and \"Branch\" parameters of a search and enumerate the full database. CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges - CVE-2016-5654 According to the reporter, a remote authenticated attacker able to execute a man-in-the-middle attack may be able to tamper with the \"xmlMessageOut\" parameter of a client POST request to escalate privileges to administrator. CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation - CVE-2016-5655 According to the reporter, a remote unauthenticated attacker able to execute a man-in-the-middle attack may be able to present an alternate SSL certificate and therefore decrypt all traffic between the client and FusionCapital Opics Plus server. Misys has responded to these issues with the following statement: Misys has analysed the reported vulnerabilities and determined that they could \nrelate to a specific older version, but not for all versions, of one of our \napplications, with the matter being rectified with a user configuration change \nor non-emergency software patch. In short, we identified that the sql \ninjection vulnerability is true positive and the other two reported \nvulnerabilities are misconfigurations. For more information, our Opics clients \nare being directed to contact their Misys Customer Advocate.",
