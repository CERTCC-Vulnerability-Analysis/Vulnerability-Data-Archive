  "Description": "Frontel uses a custom protocol running on TCP port 888. The protocol performs an authentication handshake using AES-128 and a pre-shared key, and then sends data. CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key - CVE-2015-8252 The authentication protocol uses a pre-shared key that entirely derived from the serial number of the device. This serial number is transmitted in the plain in messages, allowing an attacker to determine the key. CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data - CVE-2015-8253 Messages and videos are sent unencrypted after the AES authentication handshake. The messages are sent in plain text, and the videos are sent as MJPEG video. CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity - CVE-2015-8254 Messages are sent without any integrity protection of the data. Messages may be spoofed to, for example, send false alarm signals or deactivate alarms. For more information, please see the researcher's blog post.",
