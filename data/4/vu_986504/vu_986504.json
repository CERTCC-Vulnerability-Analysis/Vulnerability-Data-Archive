Should the flaw re-occur again, a recommended course of action until an update is developed is: Do not open unknown .cda, .pls or .m3u files. Do not open .cda, .pls or .m3u files automatically with WinAmp in your web browser. Of course, these recommendations always apply to any unknown files and file types. It is also always advised for all users to ensure their browser settings prompt for the desired action (Save, Cancel, Open) with all file types that may load remote data, such as WinAmp .pls or .m3u playlist file types.",
