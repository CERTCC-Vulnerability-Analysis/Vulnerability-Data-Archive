  "Description": "Netgear GS105PE Prosafe Plus Switch contains hard-coded login credentials that can be used for authenticating to the web server running on the device. The username is ntgruser and the password is debugpassword. Once authenticated, the web server provides access to: produce_burn.cgi : Modify the serial number and MAC address of the product\nregister_debug.cgi : Allow the user to manually set memory to a certain value and extract that value from it\nbootcode_update.cgi : Allow the user to upload new firmware.
