  "Description": "NTP.org's reference implementation of NTP server, ntpd, contains multiple vulnerabilities. A brief overview follows, but details may be found in NTP's security advisory listing and in the individual links below. CRYPTO-NAK denial of service introduced in Sec 3007 patch. See Sec 3046, CVE-2016-4957. The CVSS score below describes this vulnerability. Bad authentication demobilizes ephemeral associations. See Sec 3045, CVE-2016-4953. Processing of spoofed server packets affects peer variables. See Sec 3044, CVE-2016-4954. Autokey associations may be reset when repeatedly receiving spoofed packets. See Sec 3043, CVE-2016-4955. Broadcast associations are not covered in Sec 2978 patch, which may be leveraged to flip broadcast clients into interleave mode. See Sec 3042, CVE-2016-4956.",
