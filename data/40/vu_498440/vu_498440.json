  "Impact": "If the ISN of an existing connection can be determined within some practical range, a malicious agent may be able to close or hijack the connection. If the ISNs of future connections are targeted, an agent may be able to \"complete\" a TCP three-way handshake and spoof TCP packets delivered to a victim.",

  "Overview": "Attacks against TCP initial sequence number generation have been discussed for some time now. It has long been recognized that the ability to know or predict ISNs can lead to TCP connection hijacking or spoofing. What was not previously illustrated was just how predictable one commonly-used method of randomizing new connection ISNs is in some modern TCP/IP implementations.",
