  "Description": "The ICU Project describes ICU as \"a mature, widely used set of C/C++ and Java libraries providing Unicode and Globalization support for software applications.\" CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow - CVE-2014-8146 Multiple out-of-bounds writes may occur in the resolveImplicitLevels function of ubidi.c in affected versions of ICU4C. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound - CVE-2014-8147 An integer overflow may occur in the resolveImplicitLevels function of ubidi.c in affected versions of ICU4C due to the assignment of an int32 value to an int16 type. Both issues may lead to denial of service and the possibility of code execution. For more details, refer to Pedro Ribeiro's disclosure.",
