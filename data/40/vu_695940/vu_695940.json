  "Description": "CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow From the researcher, the variable len that holds the length of a regular expression string is \"enlarged to such an extent that, in the process of enlarging (multiplication and addition), causes the 32 bit register/variable to overflow.\" It may be possible for an attacker to use this overflow to change data in memory. More details are given on the researcher's blog. The nature of the overflow suggests that only 32-bit operating systems are affected; it is highly unlikely that 64-bit operating systems would allow such an overflow.",
