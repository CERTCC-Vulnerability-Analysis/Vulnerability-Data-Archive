Authenticate BGP messages TCP MD5 (RFC 2385), IPsec, and S-BGP provide cryptographic authentication of network connections and/or BGP messages. Various performance and key distribution issues are associated with these authentication methods. Use out-of-band management channels When possible, use an out-of-band channel, such as a separate network, to transmit BGP other management traffic.",
