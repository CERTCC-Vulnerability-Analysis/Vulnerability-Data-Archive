  "Workarounds": "Always authenticate to Secure RPC before generating SSH keys using the \"SUN-DES-1\" passphrase. If your login password is the same as your Secure RPC password, the standard Solaris login methods (login, dtlogin, etc.) will authenticate you to Secure RPC. Otherwise, you should run keylogin to authenticate to Secure RPC. For better assurance, remove the nobody user entry from the /etc/publickey file or, for a more complete fix, run keyserv with the \"-d\" flag.",

  "Overview": "The secure-RPC feature of the SSH1 client in Solaris sometimes encrypts the SSH private key file with a weak passphrase, which can be determined by an attacker and used to recover the SSH private keys. Other versions of the SSH client running on non-Solaris platforms are not affected by this vulnerability.",
