  "Workarounds": "Workarounds and/or fixes: 1) performing a chroot(1) as well as an su(1). This has additional advantages,\nalthough the configuration and maintenance of chrooted environments adds to\nthe headaches of system management. 2) Sanitizing (removing shell metacharacters) from the $log and $host\nvariables prior to issuing the su(1) in the /usr/lpp/x_st_mgr/bin/login\nscript. This should be sufficient. Problem Analysis: The problem is caused by the line in /usr/lpp/x_st_mgr/bin/login that reads: su nobody -c \"rlogin $host -l $log\" The variables host and log are evaluated before they are passed to \"nobody\"'s\nshell for interpretation. In the example, the command(s) passed to the\nrestricted shell are: rlogin localhost -l ; aixterm -ut The first command fails in its parameter-checking phase and emits instructions\non proper usage. The second command, however, causes a terminal emulation\nwindow to appear on the intruder's display, giving interactive access to the\nsystem as well as full access to the current $DISPLAY.
