  "Description": "From the Cisco Advisory: \n\nSummary\n=======\nCertain versions of Cisco IOS software may crash or hang when they receive\ninvalid user datagram protocol (UDP) packets sent to their \"syslog\" ports\n(port 514). At least one commonly-used Internet scanning tool generates\npackets which can cause such crashes and hangs. This fact has been announced\non public Internet mailing lists which are widely read both by security\nprofessionals and by security \"crackers\", and should be considered public\ninformation.",
