  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access to the server Until the appropriate patches can be applied, we recommend restricting remote access to the OPC server to only trusted hosts by using firewalls or only connecting them to private networks. As a best practice, critical systems, such as industrial control systems, should either not be connected to corporate networks, or should be connected in a limited and controlled way. For instance, if connecting the control system network to the corporate network is necessary, then a firewall should be deployed to limit traffic flow between the two networks.",
