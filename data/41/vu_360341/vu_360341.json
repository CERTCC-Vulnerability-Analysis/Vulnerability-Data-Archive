  "Description": "BIND 9 contains a vulnerability in DNSSEC validation code. According to ISC: There was an error in the DNSSEC NSEC/NSEC3 validation code that could cause bogus NXDOMAIN responses (that is, NXDOMAIN responses for records proven by NSEC or NSEC3 to exist) to be cached as if they had validated correctly, so that future queries to the resolver would return the bogus NXDOMAIN with the AD flag set. This issue affects BIND versions 9.0.x, 9.1.x, 9.2.x, 9.3.x, 9.4.0 -> 9.4.3-P4, 9.5.0 -> 9.5.2-P1, 9.6.0 -> 9.6.1-P2",
