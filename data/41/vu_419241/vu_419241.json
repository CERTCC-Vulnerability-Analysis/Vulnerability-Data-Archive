  "Workarounds": "According to the WRQ Tech note, the following workaround may prevent exploitation of the vulnerability: On UNIX Servers 1. Edit the SSH server's sshd2_config file: 1. Change the line subsystem-sftp internal://sftp-server to subsystem-sftp sftp-server Note: This change disallows the use of chroot. 2. Comment out the SftpSyslogFacility keyword line. Note: The line should begin with two \"pound\" signs, as in this example: ## SftpSyslogFacility LOCAL7 2. Restart the SSH server to read the changes in the configuration file. On Windows Servers\nThe only workaround is to disable the sftp subsystem as follows: 1. Edit the SSH server's sshd2_config file and comment out the subsystem-sftp line. Note: The line should begin with two \"pound\" signs, as in this example: ## subsystem-sftp \"fsshsftpd.exe\" 2. Restart the SSH server to read the change in the configuration file.",
