  "Description": "If you switch on X.25 routing on a Cisco router then the XOT\nprotocol (X.25 over TCP, see RFC 1613) is automatically enabled,\ntoo. There is no access control on the opened TCP port 1998 so\neveryone is able to connect to this port and use their router for\nX.25 traffic. Beside the problem of charging the traffic to the\naffected side the other problem is that you can use the identity of\nthe misused router to access other systems.",
