Do not allow WordPad to parse embedded files Microsoft WordPad is the default application for opening and interacting with RTF files in Microsoft Windows. Preventing WordPad from parsing embedded OLE objects in RTF files may partially mitigate this vulnerability. See the workarounds section of Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-012 for instructions on how to edit the Windows registry to prevent WordPad from parsing these objects.",
