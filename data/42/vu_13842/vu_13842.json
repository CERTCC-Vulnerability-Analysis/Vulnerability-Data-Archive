  "Description": "PROBLEM 1 DESCRIPTION\n\nThe CERN Web server allows a Webmaster to specify that selected\nWeb pages should be served to only certain network sites or only\nif the viewer can supply the correct password.  This access\nconfiguration is specified in the \"httpd.conf\" file.\n\nThese restrictions may be trivially bypassed by altering the\npathname of the file in the URL to something that is equivalent\nto the underlying file system but that will not exactly match the\nrestriction specified in the \"httpd.conf\" file.\n\nThis hole is being actively exploited.\n\n\nPROBLEM 2 DESCRIPTION\n\nThe utility program \"CGIParse\" is intended to be used by CGI\nshell scripts to parse data that was entered into a form by a\nperson running a browser and sent to the local Web server.  It\nassembles a shell command to set the environment variable\n\"QUERY_STRING\", but does not adequately protect against\nshell-significant characters within the string value passed from\nthe browser.  This allows a malicious person to embed arbitrary\nshell-commands within the string and cause them to be executed by\nthe shell process running the CGI script.",
