  "Description": "The ObjectServer is a package supplied by SGI to provide\ncoordination between logical objects (e.g. devices).  The server\ncommunicates with its clients via a proprietary protocol that uses\nUDP port 5135.  The package is no longer provided by SGI, but it\ndoes seem to be supported.\n\nIn this vulnerability the attacker appears to have reverse\nengineered the protocol to induce the server program to execute\narbitrary commands.  No further details are available from SGI as\nyet.",
