  "Description": "                   Advisory on OSF/DCE Security Hole\n                             July 19, 1995\n\n\n       It has been discovered that OSF/DCE security has a flawed aliasing\n       mechanism in its registry that can potentially yield a less secure\n       DCE cell.\n\n     PROBLEM:\n       Multiple administrators in a DCE cell (i.e., principals with the\n       privileges required to create principals and accounts within the DCE\n       registry), some of which are intended to be less trusted than the\n       cell administrator (e.g., principals intended to be restricted to\n       create principals and accounts only within a subset of DCE registry\n       name space), cannot be prevented from acquiring full privileges of\n       the cell administrator. Due to a flaw in the DCE security registry\n       such less privileged administrators are able to gain full privileges\n       by creating an alias to the cell administrator. The security server\n       grants an alias principal full rights of the principal it is aliased\n       to.\n\n       DCE security registry principals are generally not allowed to create\n       accounts. Only an account designated as some type of administrator,\n       by explicitly creating ACL entries for that principal, allows it to\n       do things to the registry that normal users are not allowed to do,\n       that is, create principals and accounts in a certain part of the\n       security name space. In OSF/DCE as it ships, only cell_admin is\n       given such privileges. To that effect, the DCE cell administrator can\n       prevent any loss of security by following the guidelines described\n       below.\n\n     HOW TO AVOID:\n       This security hole has existed in all releases of OSF/DCE todate.\n       To avoid the problem in releases prior to OSF/DCE 1.1, the DCE cell\n       administrators should not explicitly give registry administration\n       rights to principals that would not otherwise have access to the\n       cell administrator account itself. As distributed by OSF, only\n       cell_admin is given such rights.\n\n       OSF is in the process of providing a fix for this defect to DCE 1.1 \n       support licensees for them to apply to their DCE 1.1 based products.\n       The end-users may ask their DCE vendors for such a fix. All future\n       releases of OSF/DCE will have this fix incorporated.",
