Since the Apache service typically runs with SYSTEM privileges on Windows NT and Windows 2000, an attacker may be able to gain complete control of the system.",

  "Workarounds": "Block or Restrict Access Monitor and/or restrict access to the Apache HTTP service (typically 80/tcp). It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall or Intrusion Detection System (IDS) may be able to filter requests made to Apache. Access to the PL/SQL gateway administration web pages can be restricted by specifying authorized user names and connect strings or an administrative Database Access Descriptor (DAD) in the PL/SQL gateway configuration file, /Apache/modplsql/cfg/wdbsvr.app. For more information, read the section titled Using the PL/SQL Gateway in the Oracle iAS documentation for the Oracle HTTP Server powered by Apache. Note that these workarounds are designed to limit access and detect exploit attempts. These workarounds do not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Disable Vulnerable Service Disable the PL/SQL service (modplsql or mod_plsql in Apache).",

  "Overview": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Apache Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). Specifying a crafted password for a Database Access Descriptor (DAD) could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Apache service.",
