  "Impact": "This makes it possible for an attacker to use a spoofed UDP packet\nto carry out a set or unset request. Assuming an attacker can register a bogus service this makes it\npossible for her/him to carry out server replacement\nattacks. For instance, an attacker could possibly replace\nan NIS server with one which serves a bogus user database. Note that while\nan attacker can register these services remotely, a user still must\nhave shell access to the target in order to run a trojan rpc\nserver.",

  "Description": "(SNI words) When an RPC service first starts, it sends the portmapper or\nrpcbind an unset request for its service, followed by a set\nrequest.  Clients trying to connect to it then query\nportmapper/rpcbind to determine which port the service is on. The\nproblem here is that some rpcbind/portmapper implementations make\nno effort to discern which machine issues the set or unset request.\nEven worse, most RPC implementations which do check the source\naddress of set and unset requests use the ip address of the\nethernet interface when performing set and unset requests.",
