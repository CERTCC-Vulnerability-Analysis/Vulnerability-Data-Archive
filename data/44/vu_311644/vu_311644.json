  "Description": "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') pd-admin, contains cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The vulnerability report provided by Thomas Roth states: Reflective cross-site scripting\nWhen pasting the string below into the 'Create new directory' textfield (found under 'WebFTP' -> 'Overview'), the error page will include the attacker supplied JavaScript code. \"><script>alert(\"XSS\");</script> Stored cross-site scripting\nWhen storing the string below as the body for an e-mail autoresponder, every time someone tries to change the text of the autoresponder, the attacker supplied JavaScript code will execute. By tricking a (higher privileged) support contact into looking at it, the attacker might be able to steal the support contact's session cookie. </textarea> <script> alert(\"XSS\");</script>",

Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host.
