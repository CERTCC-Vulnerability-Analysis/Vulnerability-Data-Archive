  "Impact": "A local attacker can derive the contents of memory shared with another process on the same L3 cache (same physical CPU). Virtualization and cryptographic software are examples that are likely to be vulnerable. An attacker on the same host operating system only needs read access to the executable file or a shared library component of the target process. An attacker on a different virtual machine similarly needs access to an exact copy of the executable or shared library used by the target process, and the hypervisor needs to have memory page de-duplication enabled.",

  "Description": "Common x86 CPU architecture is susceptible to a Flush+Reload side-channel attack, as described in \"Recovering OpenSSL ECDSA Nonces Using the FLUSH+RELOAD Cache Side-channel Attack\" by Yarom and Benger. By manipulating memory stored in the x86 architecture by a target process and observing timing differences between requests for cached and non-cached memory, an attacker can derive specific information about the target process. The paper demonstrates an attack against OpenSSL. This vulnerability is an example of CWE-200: Information Exposure. This is similar to VU#976534, which demonstrated an attack on the L3 shared cache architecture against GnuPG.",
