  "Description": "Libpurple is an instant messenger (IM) library that is used by various programs to connect to multiple networks. Libpurple contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be triggered by sending specially crafted MSNSLP messages to a program that is using an affected version of the library. For more technical details, see CORE Advisory CORE-2009-0727.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade\nInstant messenger programs may distribute Libpurple and will provide an updated version to their users as a security update. See the systems affected portion of this document for a partial list of affected IM clients. Users who compile Libpurple or IM programs should see the Libpurple site or their operating system vendor for updated software.",
