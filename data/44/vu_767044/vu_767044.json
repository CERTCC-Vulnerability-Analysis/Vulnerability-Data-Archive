  "Description": "CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function It has been reported that Hanvon biometric facial recognition devices running software versions prior to 1.007.110 do not authenticate network connections or API commands. Hanvon devices provide a plain-text management protocol/API on port 9922/tcp. An attacker with network access can connect to devices using telnet or a similar terminal or TCP socket utility, with no authentication. It has been reported the following devices are affected: F710, F810, FA007, FK800, and earlier series. It is possible that all Hanvon facial recognition devices could be affected.",
