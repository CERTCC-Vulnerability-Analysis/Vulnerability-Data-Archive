Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an SQL request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing a web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location.",
