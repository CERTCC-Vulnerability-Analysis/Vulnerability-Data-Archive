  "Description": "According to ISC: named, acting as a DNSSEC validator, was determining if an NS RRset is insecure based on a value that could mean either that the RRset is actually insecure or that there wasn't a matching key for the RRSIG in the DNSKEY RRset when resuming from validating the DNSKEY RRset. This can happen when in the middle of a DNSKEY algorithm rollover, when two different algorithms were used to sign a zone but only the new set of keys are in the zone DNSKEY RRset.",
