  "Description": "Fuzzing the first 296 bytes of an SMB packet may in some cases cause a denial of service condition on the HP Photosmart B210 printer. This is a persistent denial of service that requires the printer to be manually restarted to resume normal operations. HP has released the following statement: \"HP has examined this issue reported on the Photosmart B210 and has verified the printer could become unresponsive when fuzzed with the code provided. At no time did we identify buffer overflows with this tool nor our code inspection. The attempted attack produces a non-permanent denial of service. HP's recommendation for existing models affected by this attack is to power cycle the device to return it to a working state. HP continually works to improve security and is taking steps to ensure current and future products are not susceptible to this attack.\" The underlying cause of the crash remains unclear.",
