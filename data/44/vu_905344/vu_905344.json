  "Description": "Web browsers and operating systems making a HTTPS request via a proxy server are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against HTTP CONNECT requests and proxy response messages. HTTP CONNECT requests are made in clear text over HTTP, meaning an attacker in the position to modify proxy traffic may force the use of 407 Proxy Authentication Required responses to phish for credentials. WebKit-based clients are vulnerable to additional vectors due to the fact that HTML markup and JavaScript are rendered by the client Document Object Model (DOM) in the context of the originally requested HTTPS domain. For more information, refer to the FalseCONNECT website.",
