  "Description": "I have found a nice little security hole in PC-NFS version 5.x.  If you\nping a PC-NFS user with a packet size of between 1450 to 1480, the\nPC'92s ICMP reply packet will divulge:\n\no The hostname of the PC\no The hostname of the PC'92s authentication server\no The username of the person logged in\no The password for the user (Thank you very much!)\n\nAll of this information is in clear text unless PC-NFS92's NETLOGIN is\nused.  NETLOGIN uses XOR as its encryption, so this is hardly secure\neither.\n\nNDIS, ODI, 3C503 drivers on SMC and 3C503 cards have been tested\nand all freely return the above information on both PC-NFS versions\n5.0 and 5.1a.  This should work with other driver/NIC configurations\nalso.\n\nYou get the occasional added bonus of locking up the victims PC as\nwell!\n\nThis bug was new to Sun and they have created a new PCNFS.SYS\ndriver for us.  They have labeled it PC-NFS.SYS version 5.1a.DOD.\n\nThis new version fills reply ICMP packets with nulls after 200 bytes of\nthe requested pattern.",

  "Workarounds": "Until you receive this patch from Sun, I\nwould recommend setting all external router interface MTU to a value\nof no greater than 1350 as this is point where secrets are contained\nin the return packet.
