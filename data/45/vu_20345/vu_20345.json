  "Impact": "Problem 1 Remote users can poison nameserver caches by forging UDP packets. This allows a variety of subsequent attacks to take place (such as\ninterception of email, redirection of IP traffic to snarf passwords\nand so on). See [#97.14191] and [#97.14206].

The speculation is that a worst\ncase scenario is that a remote user may be able to execute\narbitrary commands on a victim host.",

  "Description": "(SNI words) Problem 1.\n\nDNS resolves names and addresses using either an iterative or\nrecursive technique (configurable, with recursive the default).\nThis vul is related to recursive name resolution.\n\nWhen a name/address is resolved, it is done by sending a query\n(with a sequence number) to the appropriate nameserver. It receives\nthe response (with the same sequence number) and then (a) caches\nthe response for shorter turnaround time next time, and (b) passes\nthe answer back to the requesting client.\n\nThere are two implementatios problems. The first is that the\nsequence numbers are predictable. The second is that the requesting\nnameserver will believe the FIRST response it gets back, without\nchecking that it actually came from the nameserver it thought it\nwas asking.\n\nThis means that if we engineer a request from a target nameserver,\nand then send it back a spoofed response (before the real\nnameserver sends back the legitimate response) we can not only\npoison the cache in the target (victim) nameserver, but we can make\nthe poisoned cache stay there if we give it a large TTL value.  The\nlegitimate response from the legitimate nameserver (which arrives\nafter our spoofed response) is ignored by the victim nameserver as\na duplicate.\n\nThis then allows us to mount a variety of attacks as outlined in\nthe messages below.\n\nProblem 2.\n\nThere exists a potential buffer overflow in the DNS code due to the\nwrong constant being specified in a buffer variable.",
