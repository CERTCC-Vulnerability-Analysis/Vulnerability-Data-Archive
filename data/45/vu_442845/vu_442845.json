  "Impact": "Remote attackers may be able to execute PHP code of their choosing on a vulnerable\u00a0system. The code would be executed in the context of the server program that runs the corresponding web application. Secondary impacts of a compromised web service account include, but are not limited to, malicious modification of web site data, information disclosure, and access that may be leveraged to gain additional system privileges.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade or apply a patch Various vendors have published patches and updated versions of their software to address this issue. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for information on a specific product or vendor. Note that because the vulnerability exists in a common extension module, any application that uses the flawed code, including custom applications, may expose the vulnerability. Developers who bundle their own versions of the XML-RPC library with their application should exercise extra care to evaluate their own potential use of the vulnerable code.",
