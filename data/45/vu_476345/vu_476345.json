  "Workarounds": "Restrict access Restricting access to a vulnerable system by using host or network based firewalls may prevent a remote attacker from exploiting this vulnerability. For more information refer to Citect security article Securing Your SCADA Network. Restricting access may result in loss of ODBC Server connectivity. According to Core Security Technologies Advisory: The vulnerability is located in the ODBC server service, vulnerable organizations that do not require ODBC connectivity may disable the service with no adverse effects to the CitectSCADA software. Installations that require ODBC connectivity to SQL databases, spreadsheets, etc. will suffer loss of connection with ODBC data sources if this workaround is applied. Vulnerable organizations should obtain positive verification that ODBC connectivity is not necessary in their installation and prepare appropriate contingency procedures before the workaround is applied.",
