  "Workarounds": "Disable Winamp playlist file association Disable the file association for Winamp playlist files to help prevent windows applications from using Winamp to open playlists. This can be accomplished by deleting the following registry key: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Winamp.Playlist\nConfigure your web browser Because a web browser can be used as an attack vector for this vulnerability, configure your web browser to prompt before opening Winamp playlist files. This can help prevent automated exploitation as the result of viewing a web page. Internet Explorer Internet Explorer will open Winamp playlist files without prompting the user. It is possible to modify this behavior so that Internet Explorer will prompt the user before opening Winamp playlist files. To make this change, modify the following registry value: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Winamp.Playlist\\EditFlags Set the value to: REG_BINARY 00 00 00 00 Mozilla Firefox The default configuration of Mozilla Firefox appears to prompt before opening Winamp playlist files. However, if the user has chosen to have playlist files open without prompting, this behavior can be reset by following the instructions in the document Securing Your Web Browser. This document provides instructions for how to configure Mozilla Firefox to save various file types to disk, rather than opening them with the associated application. Do not open Winamp playlist files Do not open Winamp playlist files (.PLS or .M3U) from untrusted sources.",
