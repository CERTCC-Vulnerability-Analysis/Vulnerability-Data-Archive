  "Description": "Wyse Device Manager (WDM, formerly known as Wyse Rapport) manages thin clients. Part of the server component (HServer) is implemented as an ISAPI filter on the Microsoft Windows Internet Information Server (IIS) platform. The client component (HAgent) runs as a service on Microsoft Windows systems. WDM components contain several vulnerabilities: HServer (hserver.dll) User-Agent header stack buffer overflow and\nHAgent (hagent.exe) heap overflow (both overflows are CVE-2009-0693)\nHAgent does not authenticate commands (CVE-2009-0695)\nThe first two issues are implementation defects. The third issue is caused by the lack of adequate cryptographic authentication and authorization.",
