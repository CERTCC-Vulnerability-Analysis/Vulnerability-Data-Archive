  "Description": "Some system directories (/bin, /etc, /usr/sbin) have group-write\npermission to group 'bin'.  This means that if you have 'bin' group\naccess you can move executables around in that directory, possibly\nreplacing essential system executables.  The method I used was to\nmove 'in.ftpd' (the ftp response deamon) to 'in.ftpd.bak', then replace\nthe executable with my own code (with only 'bin' permissions).  This\ncode moved a copy of a Solaris 1.1 /bin/sh to my directory, changed\nthe owner to root, then changed the permission to 4755.  It would not\nbe runnable by anyone but root, but thankfully when you ftp to\na machinethe 'in.ftpd' program is run as 'root'.\n\nThe way to get 'bin' group permissions is to mount the\n/var/mail directory (of the target machine) on a machine you\nhave root access to.\tThis directory is AUTOMATICALLY\nexported when the NIS+ option is used under Solaris 2.3\ninstall.  Then you copy your /bin/sh to the targets\n/var/mail directory, change the group to bin, and change the\npermission to 2755.\n\n\nWhat's really important in this particular hack is to use a\nSolaris 1.1 /bin/sh, because it uses the effective user\npermissions, as opposed to your real user permissions.  The\nSolaris 2.3 /bin/sh uses your real permissions.",
