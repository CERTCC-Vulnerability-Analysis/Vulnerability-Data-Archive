  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access\nYou may wish to block access to from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to TCP and UDP ports 135, 139, and 445. This will limit your exposure to attacks. However, blocking at the network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate",
