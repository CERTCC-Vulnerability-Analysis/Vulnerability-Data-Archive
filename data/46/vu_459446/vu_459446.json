  "Description": "It has been reported that osCommerce 2.3.1 using the PayPal website payments standard module 1.0 contains a design flaw that allows an attacker to buy items without having to pay for them. The parameter for the merchant's PayPal email address is controlled on the client-side and not verified by the server. This allows an attacker to change the PayPal email address to one the attacker controls allowing the attacker to purchase items on a website but effectively pay themselves instead of the merchant. Manual verification of website orders with the PayPal transactions would need to be performed to detect this fraud.",
