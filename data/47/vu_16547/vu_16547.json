  "Description": "login(1) is a program used at the beginning of each terminal session\nthat allows users to identify themselves to the session.  Under current\nversions of IRIX this functionality is supplied by the program\n/usr/lib/iaf/scheme.  The login program is a symbolic link to\n/usr/lib/iaf/scheme.\n\nDue to insufficient bounds checking on arguments which are supplied\nby users, it is possible to overwrite the internal stack space of the\nscheme program while it is executing.  By supplying a carefully designed\nargument to the scheme program, intruders may be able to force scheme to\nexecute arbitrary commands.  As scheme is setuid root, this may allow\nintruders to run arbitrary commands with root privileges.\n\nSilicon Graphics Inc. acknowledges the login/scheme buffer overrun\nvulnerability publically reported by several individuals and in AUSCERT\nAdvisory AA-97.22.\n\nCurrently, Silicon Graphics Inc. is investigating and no further information\nis available for public release at this time.\n\nAs further information becomes available, additional advisories will be\nissued via the normal SGI security information distribution methods\nincluding the wiretap mailing list.",
