  "Impact": "Remote attackers can complete the three way handshake for establishing a TCP connection without receiving the packets sent by the terminal server. They can use this connection to do IP spoofing on TCP connections. With knowledge of the port numbers and hosts involved, an attacker may be able to inject data into an established TCP connection (hijacking). The injection of data into a privileged connection is likely to grant privileged access to the terminal server.",

  "Resolution": "This problem is reported to occur at least under versions 3.3.1b6 and 3.0.4. It was present in Livingston terminal servers in 1996, 1997, and 1998. Livingston has been acquired by Lucent and it is not clear what the status of the vulnerability is at this time.",
