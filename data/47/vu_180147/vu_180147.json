  "Workarounds": "1. Install a firewall and restrict access to port 1521 from outside the network. 2. Configure the Oracle Listener to run on a port other than 1521. 3. Remove PLSExtproc and icache_extproc functionality from Oracle if not needed, by deleting relevant lines from the \"tnsnames.ora\" and \"listener.ora\" files. 4. Implement trust node checking by adding the following lines to the \"sqlnet.ora\" file: tcp.validnode_checking = YES\ntcp.invited_nodes = (<comma-delimited list of allowed hostnames or IP addrs>) 5. On Windows, run Oracle processes under a low-privileged user account instead of under the local SYSTEM account.",
