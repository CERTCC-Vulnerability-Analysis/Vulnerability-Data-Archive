  "Description": "In a Tor circuit, the RELAY and RELAY_EARLY commands can be used as a covert channel. An adversary who controls both ends of the circuit can correlate Tor client and destination IP addresses by transmitting the destination using the covert channel. The adversary can increase the chances of their entry and exit nodes being selected by providing stable, high-bandwidth nodes (and something else?). The covert channel can also be used to identify hidden services by monitoring entry nodes and hidden service directories. Same for entry node and rendezvous node. The covert channel works between the ends of any Tor circuit, both ends controlled by adversary. Another vulnerability: Hidden service descriptor IDs can be calculated by anyone, including an adversary. Adversary can also find public/private key pairs that put nodes in position to be selected as HSDirs, so hidden services will publish descriptors and clients will fetch descriptors from them. Sybil attack on HSDirs, https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8244.",
