  "Description": "CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity - CVE-2016-2346 According to the researcher, Allround Automations PL/SQL Developer version 11 periodically checks for updates over HTTP. When an update is available, PL/SQL Developer downloads the update and executes the update without verifying authenticity or performing other checks. By intercepting such requests and modifying the necessary fields, an attacker with a man-in-the-middle position between the victim and the network may be able write arbitrary data to vulnerable devices and execute arbitrary code with permissions of the PL/SQL Developer user. The researcher has published a blog post with more information.",
