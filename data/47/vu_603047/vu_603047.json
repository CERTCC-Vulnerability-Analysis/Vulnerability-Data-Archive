  "Description": "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') - CVE-2016-5639 A path traversal vulnerability exists in login.cgi (and possibly other binaries in the /home/boa/cgi-bin directory) on the AM-100 embedded web server. The src GET parameter passed to login.cgi specifies the relative path to a file for rendering, such as AwLoginDownload.html. However, the value of this parameter can specify an arbitrary path on the AM-100 filesystem. CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') - CVE-2016-5640 A command injection vulnerability exists in rftest.cgi on the AM-100 embedded web server. The ATE_COMMAND POST parameter specifies the path to a command for the underlying OS to execute. By default, the value of this parameter is /sbin/iwpriv; however, the value of this parameter can be a relative or absolute path to any arbitrary command on the underlying OS. Crestron AirMedia AM-100 firmware v1.1.1.11 - v1.2.1 are confirmed affected by the researcher. For more information see the researcher's advisory one and advisory two.",
