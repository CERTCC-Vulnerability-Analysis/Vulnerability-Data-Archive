  "Resolution": "If remote connections to the machine are not required, disable them to mitigate attacks. If disabling is not an option, modify the configuration file to permit remote connections from only authorized addresses. Note that this may not be sufficient to block attacks from hosts that use other methods such as IP address spoofing. In addition, implementing a firewall to permit access to the XDMCP port (177/UDP, may vary based on system) from only authorized sources on the network may also help mitigate the exploitation vulnerability. To disable remote connections comment out the following two lines in the \"Xaccess\" configuration file by adding a # symbol to the beginning of each line: *\t\t\t\t#any host can get a login window\n* CHOOSER BROADCAST \t#any indirect host can get a chooser becomes #*\t\t\t#any host can get a login window\n#* CHOOSER BROADCAST \t#any indirect host can get a chooser",
