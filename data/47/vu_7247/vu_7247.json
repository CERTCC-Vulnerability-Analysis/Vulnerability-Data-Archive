  "Description": "\nMany NFS implementations do not perform any checking on the source\nport number of NFS requests. Therefore an NFS client can be\nconstructed without privileged system calls and bind to non-privileged\nport numbers (>1023) to access vulnerable NFS servers. The mounted\nfilesystem may then be leveraged to gain root privileges on the local\nmachine.\n\nThe vulnerability was tested by a third-party and found not to be\npresent in C2 secure-mode Sun systems.\n\nAny machine that has read/write access to any point of a vulnerable\nNFS server's file system can read/write the entire file system, as any\nuser. If the filesystem is exported without root-to-nobody mapping,\nthis may allow any user of that file system to become root on the\nserver.\n",
