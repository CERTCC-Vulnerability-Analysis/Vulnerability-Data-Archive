  "Description": "STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW\nThe COM and ActiveX controls included in the software do not provide adequate checking of input data. A user or program could call one of the controls\u2019 interfaces with specially crafted input data that can overflow the stack pointer or cause the control to stop execution. The ActiveX controls have been registered as scriptable, which means that they can be included and scripted from remotely served web pages.",
