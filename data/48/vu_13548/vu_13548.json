  "Description": "The Kungl Tekniska Hogskolan (KTH) implementation of Kerberos 4 has\na vulnerability which can allow a local user to gain root access\nunder some circumstances.\n\nIn this system, Kerberos tickets are stored in a file accessible to\nonly the user and root.  The file is owned by the user set has\npermissions set to 0600.  The name of this file is stored in the\nKRBTKFILE environment variable.\n\nThe setuid root programs rsh, rcp and rlogin use this environment\nvariable to access the ticket from the appropriate file.  If the\nuser sets the environment variable to another file and executes the\ncommand, then they gain the effective uid of that file owner.\n\nFor example:\n\nmarita:/tmp>id\nuid=18348(art) gid=30(usr) groups=30(usr), 0(wheel)\nmarita:/tmp>ls -l\n[...]\n-rw-------  1 root  wheel  241 Nov  3 02:28 tkt0\n[...]\nmarita:/tmp>export KRBTKFILE=\"/tmp/tkt0\"\nmarita:/tmp>rsh -l root marita 'id'\nuid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel), 7(authread)",
