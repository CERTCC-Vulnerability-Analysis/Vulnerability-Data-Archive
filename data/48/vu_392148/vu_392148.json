Filter network traffic to the ISAKMP daemon\nPermit network traffic to the ISAKMP daemon (500/udp) from only trusted hosts. This will not mitigate attacks from within the firewall perimeter, but may mitigate attacks from outside your network. As a matter of good security practice, users who have applied the patches for this vulnerability may also wish to consider implementing this step to mitigate against other unknown relevant vulnerabilities.",
