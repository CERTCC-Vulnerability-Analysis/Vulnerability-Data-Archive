CWE-384: Session Fixation - CVE-2015-2853 A user's session ID is set prior to authentication, and is not invalidated or changed at the time of authentication. An attacker capable of obtaining or setting a session ID can hijack a victim user's session. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2015-2854 Blue Coat SSL Visibility Appliance does not enforce same origin policy in X-Frame-Options response headers. An attacker can conduct clickjacking attacks via a crafted web page. CWE-200: Information Exposure - CVE-2015-2855 Sensitive cookies do not have either the Secure or HttpOnly flags set.
