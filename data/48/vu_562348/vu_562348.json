For more information see the release notes available at: http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=332231 The release notes indicate that: Incorrect handling of page template inclusions made it possible to\n     inject JavaScript code into HTML attributes, which could lead to\n     cross-site scripting attacks on a publicly editable wiki. We have not validated that the fix protects against inclusion of other active content, such as \"applet://\", \"about://\", \"activex://\", \"chrome://\", and \"script://\"",
