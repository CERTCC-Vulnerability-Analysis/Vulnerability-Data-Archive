  "Impact": "An intruder can crash vulnerable mail clients, or use them to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user reading the mail. If the operating system where the vulnerable program resides does not provide strong memory protection, an intruder who is able to crash the mail clinet may be able to crash the entire operating system. If a user with administrative access to the system (including Windows 95/Windows 98 users, as well as Unix 'root' or NT 'administrator') an intruder can use the vulnerability to gain administrative access to the system.",

  "Description": "Buffer Overflows in several MIME headers affect a large number of electronic mail clients. \n\nThe headers believed to be affected include \n\n      Content-Type\n      Content-Disposition\n      Content-Description\n      Content-ID\n\nMany MIME-aware clients do not properly check the size of the contents of those headers, though buffers to hold them are only statically allocated. Thus, those buffers are subject to overflow. By carefully crafting a message, an intruder can exploit the buffer overflow condition to cause code of the intruder's choosing to be executed on vulnerable systems. \n    ",

  "Workarounds": "There are several things that can be done to mitigate the risk if a patch cannot be installed. filter at the mail transfer agent (as in sendmail)\nfilter in procmail\nfilter in a firewall product None of these really fix the problem, but they may provide some additional protection. There are at least two downsides, however: 1) performance -- the MTA has to scan each and every message for the problem, potentially becoming a bottleneck. 2) Unless you decode the information completely, you run the risk of overlooking some aspect of the problem. Most classic filtering solutions rely on fingerprints of the problem, rather than interpreting the nature of the information that is being filtered. A common example is the difficulty firewalls face when trying to filter fragmented packets. Unless the firewall implements its own reassembly routines, it may allow inappropriate trafic to pass, or block appropriate traffic.",
