  "Description": "CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type - CVE Pending\nHP ArcSight Logger 5.3.1.6838.0 configuration import file upload capability does not sanitize file names, which allows a remote, authenticated attacker to put arbitrary files into the document root. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts on the server at the privilege level of the application. CWE-285: Improper Authorization - CVE Pending\nHP ArcSight Logger 5.3.1.6838.0 allows all users access to the Configuration->Input, Configuration->Search and Configuration->Content Management (Import/Export) features. An authenticated attacker may be able to modify ArcSight sources and parsers. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CVE Pending\nHP ArcSight ESM 6.5.0.1459.0 is vulnerable to cross-frame scripting attacks that may allow an attacker to disrupt or modify rules or resources on the system, depending on the privileges of the logged in user. CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE Pending\nHP ArcSight ESM 6.5.0.1459.0 is vulnerable to a Cross Site Request Forgery attack that may allow an attacker with knowledge of the resource id to modify rules or resources on the system, depending on the privileges of the logged in user. CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE') - CVE Pending\nArcSight Logger 5.3.1.6838.0 is vulnerable to a XML External Entity Injection vulnerability in the XML parser in the Configuration->Content Management -> Import section. An authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary scripts on the server at the privilege level of the application.",
