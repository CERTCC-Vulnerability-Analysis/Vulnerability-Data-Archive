  "Description": "It looks like in SVR4 (at least in AIX 3.2.5 and\nSolaris 2.3), the behaviour for symbolic links is as follows:\n1) anybody can create a link to any file (this is U*IX) standard)\n2) the chown, chgrp, and chmod system calls used against a symlink\nactually perform their operation against the file the symlink\npoints to, rather than the symlink inode itself (this is different\nfrom SunOS 4.X and CLIX).\n\nProblem is if a user, say \"rossdav\", creates a symlink to /etc/passwd,\nsay, the ownership and permissions are as follows:\n\n-rw-r--r--   1 root     system   /etc/passwd\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 roosdav  staff    test -> /etc/passwd\n\n- Networker comes along and backs up the symlink as usual.\n- The user then removes the link (\"rm test\") and asks the\nSystem Administrator to recover the file \"~rossdav/test\" from backups.\n- Networker restores the file, first as root, then does a chown(2)\nand chgrp(2) on the file to restore the original ownerships.\n(The reporter is guessing on this but that sequence is supported\nby their tests.)\nAt this point, under SunOS 4.X this works as expected, but on AIX,\n/etc/passwd is now owned by rossdav with \"test\" still owned by root.",
