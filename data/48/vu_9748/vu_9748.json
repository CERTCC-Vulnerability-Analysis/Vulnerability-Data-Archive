  "Description": "if you enable symbolic links in the options\ndirective for a particular directory subtree (or fail to\nspecify an options directive for a particular directory),\nusers can create symbolic links in their public_html\ndirectories which point to dangerous places such as \"/\",\nor \"/etc\", allowing them (and anyone else) to read ANY file\non the system (such as shadow password files) when the httpd\nis running as root (which is the case if httpd is called by\ninetd regardless of what user you specify for httpd to run\nas in httpd.conf).\n\nThis patch does not solve the problem that if you do not specify\na directory tree in access.conf but do allow access to that\ndirectory via srm.conf, the default options are \"all\".  This\nrequires careful maintenance of the configuration files.\n\nThere seems to be a discussion some of these issues in\nhttp://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/Overview.html\nThis is as much a configuration problem as a vul but it may\nwell be that httpd is \"too hard\" to configure safely.",

  "Workarounds": "This security hole can be closed by\nspecifying an options directive which does not allow symbolic\nlinks or which only allows symbolic links if the owners match\n(SymLinksIfOwnerMatch). Unfortunately, if some or all users\non the system have symbolic links for their home directories\n(i.e. /home/user --> /disk1/user), the httpd will refuse to\nallow access to those directories if you restrict symbolic\nlinks for the appropriate directory trees (i.e. /home or\n/home/*/.html/*) although it will work if you create\nindividual entries for each affected user in access.conf\n(i.e. /home/user1, /home/user2). This is simply not\npractical on many systems.",
