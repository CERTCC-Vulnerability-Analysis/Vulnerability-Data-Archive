  "Description": " The IRIX mediad(1M) daemon is used to monitor removable media devices on\nSilicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) platforms.\n \nUnfortunately, a vulnerability has been discovered in the default behavior\nof the mediad(1M) program that can lead to a root compromise of the system.\n \nSilicon Graphics Inc. has investigated the issue and recommends the\nfollowing steps for neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\nthat these measures be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.  This\nissue will be corrected in future releases of IRIX.\n \n ",
