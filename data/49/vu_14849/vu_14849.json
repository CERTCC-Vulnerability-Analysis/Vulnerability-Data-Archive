  "Description": "All versions of qpopper prior to 2.5 have a buffer over run problem that\nmay allow an attacker to gain root privileges.  Versions 2.5 and higher fix\nthis problem.  Updated versions of qpopper are available at:\n     ftp://ftp.qualcomm.com/Eudora/servers/unix/popper\nVersion 2.52 will fix problems with POP bulletins and some compilation\nproblems for some versions of UNIX.\n \nWho is Affected\n===============\nAll users of qpopper prior to version 2.5. To check a particular host,\ntelnet to port 110 on that host. If it is\nrunning Qpopper the banner will show the version. For example:\n \n  sh> telnet yourmailhost.your.domain.com 110\n  Trying 123.123.123.123\n  Connected to mailhost\n  +OK QPOP (version 2.4) at yourmailhost.your.domain.com starting\n \nImpact\n======\nAn intruder may be able to gain root access to systems running qpopper. The\ndetails of this exploit have been made public so it is important to upgrade\nsooner rather than later.\n \nYou should upgrade to qpopper 2.5 or later available from Qualcomm's FTP\nsite. There are no work arounds for this problem.  Some patches have been\nmade available by others, and are likely to solve the problem, but we have\nnot verified  their correctness.\n \nFurther details, questions and comments should be sent to\n<mailto:qpopper@qualcomm.com>",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade to version 2.5.2. All users of qpopper prior to version 2.5. To check a particular host,\ntelnet to port 110 on that host. If it is\nrunning Qpopper the banner will show the version. For example: sh> telnet yourmailhost.your.domain.com 110\n  Trying 123.123.123.123\n  Connected to mailhost\n  +OK QPOP (version 2.4) at yourmailhost.your.domain.com starting Details There were four overruns in the code. All have been fixed: 1. Long unknown commands. 2. Long X-UIDL header fields in mailboxes. - breaks in responses to UIDL\nand EUIDL. 3. Long From: header fields in mailboxes - breaks in responses to EUIDL. 4. Certain log messages which directly send the command input to syslog. items 1 through 3 are failing in pop_msg()\n  item 4 in pop_log() All to do with vsprintf().
