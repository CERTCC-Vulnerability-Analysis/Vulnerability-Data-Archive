  "Description": "See Sun Bugs database. The relevant BugIDs are: 1186327 and 1011792.\nThere are no patches at this time.\n\nThe following is from the Sun Bugs Database:\n\nOnce record-locking is performed on a remote file, it is not possible\nto mmap the file.  This is because the the VNOCACHE bit is set (in\nnfs_lockctl()) for locked NFS files to prevent client caching from\ninterfering with file sharing.  Mmap does not allow mapping of NFS\nfiles for which caching is disabled (nfs_map()).\n\nSince the msync() function allows cooperating programs to implement\ncache consistency, there should be a way for such programs to share\nfiles and use record-locking to control access to them.",
