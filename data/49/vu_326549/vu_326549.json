  "Description": "Microsoft Windows contains a script injection vulnerability caused by the way MHTML interprets MIME-formatted requests for content blocks within a document. According to Microsoft TechNet Security Research & Defense blog: \"It is possible under certain conditions for this vulnerability to allow an attacker to inject a client-side script in the response of a Web request run in the context of the victim's Internet Explorer. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected Web site on behalf of the targeted user.\"",
