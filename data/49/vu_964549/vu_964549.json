  "Description": "The Web Open Fonts Format (WOFF) is a simple compressed file format for fonts. Mozilla introduced support for WOFF in the 1.9.2 branch of the base software, which is used by Firefox versions 3.6 and later. An integer overflow error exists in the way the WOFF decoder handles the size of tables specified in the font file. This error could result in a buffer overflow vulnerability on a subsequent memory allocation. A remote attacker who is able to supply a malicious WOFF file could exploit this vulnerability.",
