  "Description": "On systems running Transarc's Solaris DCE integrated login program\n(login.dce in place of /bin/login) which have AFS installed but no\nAFS klog binary in any of the standard locations, unauthorized users\nmay gain access to local system resources as any valid user by supplying\na valid username for login, with any arbitrary string as a password.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an incorrect interpretation of the\nsituation which occurs when an AFS klog binary is not found by\nlogin.dce.",
