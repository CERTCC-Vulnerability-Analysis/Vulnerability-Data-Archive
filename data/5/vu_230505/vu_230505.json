  "Workarounds": "The following workarounds may mitigate this vulnerability. Restrict access \nUsing access control lists or firewall rules to limit access to port 515/tcp will prevent attackers from connecting to the LPD service. Disable the LPD service\nDisabling the LPD service will mitigate this vulnerability. See Cisco Security Response Document ID: 99109 for more information. Disable unencrypted SNMP\nThe Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) service can be used to change settings or monitor device status. Some versions of Cisco IOS support SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3. To use SNMP commands to change the hostname of an affected device, an attacker would need to know the SNMP read-write community string. SNMPv3 offers authentication and encryption features that may prevent an attacker from obtaining the read-write community string by sniffing Ethernet segments. Disable SNMP\nDisabling SNMP on affected devices may prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.",
