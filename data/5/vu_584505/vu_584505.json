  "Workarounds": "Workaround Use network and/or host based firewalls to limit connectivity to backup servers so that only trusted servers that require connectivity are allowed access. Server/workstations being backed up should only have access to the necessary ports for the back up to work correctly. At minimum, some basic protection should be in effect at the network boundaries. Individual installations may operate on nonstandard ports, which should be taken into account when developing network traffic filtering rules. We understand the following ports may be of particular interest: 10 000, 610x (e.g., 1, 3, 6).",
