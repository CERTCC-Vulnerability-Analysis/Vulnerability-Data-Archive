Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more information about specific vendors. Users who compile their own versions of BIND 8 from the original ISC source code are encouraged to take the following actions described by ISC: This issue is addressed in ISC BIND 8.4.7-P1, available as patch that  \ncan be applied to BIND 8.4.7. The more definitive solution is to upgrade to BIND 9. BIND 8 is being  \ndeclared \"end of life\" by ISC due to multiple architectural issues. See ISC's website at http://www.isc.org for more information and  \nassistance.",
