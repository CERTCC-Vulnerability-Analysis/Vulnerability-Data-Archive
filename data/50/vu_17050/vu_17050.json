  "Impact": "While it is self evident that a non-priv user would not benefit from\nthis vulnerability since the files are both owned by SYSTEM and\nlocated in SYS$SYSTEM (SYSTEM's group is still SYSTEM), the\nvulnerability really manifests itself when a \"knowledgable\" user runs\nauthorize and creates their own whatever.DAT and whatever.LIS files in\ntheir personal directory. (For example, a system manager in training\nwho's group/UIC does not automatically entitle them to SYSTEM\nprotection would be vulnerable.)",
