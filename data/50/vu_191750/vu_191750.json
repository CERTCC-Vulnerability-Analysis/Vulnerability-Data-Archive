  "Description": "The ASUS WL-330NUL Pocket Wifi router and possibly other products contain static DNS entries to the device's configuration pages. The documentation advises users to configure the device via the provided URL of www.asusnetwork .net. The device has a statically configured DNS entry for this site that directs the browser to the IP address of 192.168.1.1. If a user is not connected to an ASUS device, accessing this website in lieu of entering their router's IP address may lead the victim to a malicious site that may contain malware. At the time of publication, asusnetwork .net redirects to a site serving malware.",
