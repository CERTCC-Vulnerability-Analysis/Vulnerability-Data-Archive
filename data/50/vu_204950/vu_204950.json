  "Description": "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CVE-2013-6017 Atmail Webmail Server version 7.1.3 contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker can place the stored XSS in the e-mail body and send it to another user on the mail system, allowing them to inject arbitrary HTML content (including script). This may allow the attacker the ability to steal authentication cookies or other sensitive information. For example: <iframe width=0 height=0 src=\"javascript:alert('xss in main body')\"> CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2013-6028 Atmail Webmail Server version 7.1.3 contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The application allows authorized administrators to perform certain actions via HTTP requests. An attacker may construct a webpage and send it to a previously authenticated administrator to add, delete, or modify users, or stop the service. The CVSS score below reflects CVE-2013-6028.",
