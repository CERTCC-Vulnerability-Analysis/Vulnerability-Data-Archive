  "Resolution": "Block NetBIOS services at the the network perimeter. NetBIOS services include\nNetBIOS Name Service, 137/tcp and 137/udp\nNetBIOS Datagram Service, 138/tcp and 138/udp\nNetBIOS Session Service, 139/tcp and 139/udp Note that this prevents external hosts from sending NetBIOS Name Service traffic to internal machines, but it does not prevent local users from exploiting this vulnerability. Furthermore, the CERT/CC recommends that sites, even those which do not use NetBIOS services, block all ports unless they are explicitly needed. For Windows NT and Windows 2000, apply the patches recommended in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-047: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-047.asp http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-047.asp Note that no patch is being furnished for Win9x systems; Microsoft has publicly stated that patching these systems to disable name conflict resolution would cause more problems than it would help prevent, especially in networks with large numbers of Win9x systems. Use IPSec to help secure internal IP communication. Information about configuring IPSec in Windows 2000 can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/WINDOWS2000/library/planning/security/ipsecsteps.asp http://www.microsoft.com/WINDOWS2000/library/howitworks/security/ip_security.asp",

  "Overview": "The NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) provides a means for hostname and address mapping on a NetBIOS-aware network. The NetBIOS over TCP/IP protocols (including NBNS) are described in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments RFC1001 and RFC1002. These protocols do not specify a method for authenticating communications, and as such, machines running NetBIOS services are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. NetBIOS is a set of defined software interfaces for vendor-independent PC networking and is primarily used on Microsoft Windows computers. NetBIOS is enabled by default on Windows95 and Windows98 machines.",
