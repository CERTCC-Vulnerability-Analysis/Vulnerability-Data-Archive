  "Description": "libc uses the file specified by RESOLV_HOST_CONF instead of\n/etc/resolv.conf. The problem lies in programs which are setuid (usually\nsetuid to root... such as ping, traceroute, etc.). This bug is fixed in\nlibc-5.4.x. However, that version of the library is generally considered\nto be too buggy for \"production\" use. There *may* be patches to\nlibc-5.2.18, but I haven't been able to find them.\n\nThe solution? The latest NetKit has \"temporary\" fixes (they clean out\nthe environment). That covers a lot of the programs (ping, rsh, etc.).\nHowever, that leaves programs such as traceroute (and others such as\nssh, which you don't have). For those, you can create a program that\ncleans out the environment and then call the real program.",
