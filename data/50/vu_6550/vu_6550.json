  "Description": "Secure Networks Inc reports the following problems:\n\n(1) SNMP support on Ascend routers allows reading and writing of\nMIB variables.  The MIBs are defended by community\ndefinitions, which are effectively authentication\nmechanisms.  To read variable one joins the \"read\"\ncommunity, and to write variables, one joins the \"write\"\ncommunity. The passwords to join these communities are\ntrivial and well known.\n\n(2) The SNMP support includes extensions to provide extra\nvendor-specific functionality.  AMong the extension is a\nfacility that allows the site to manipulate the router\nconfiguration using tftp.  An attacker can leverage this\nunder some circumstances to gain complete control of the\nrouter.",
