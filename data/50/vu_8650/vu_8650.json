  "Description": "There are several coding problems in mod_include which can\nresult in a buffer overflow or in the child process going\ninto an infinite loop.\n\nThe same comments about the nature of the risk apply here as\ndo for the cfg_getline() overflow.  Generally, a user already\nneeds to have access to the server to exploit this.  Note that\nit is possible to setup a document which deliberately allows this\nto be remotely exploited, however such a document would be very\nrare in practice.\n\nIf you do not allow users to use mod_include, then they\ncan not exploit these holes.",
