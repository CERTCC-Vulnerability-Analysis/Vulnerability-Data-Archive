  "Description": "(this needs to be reworded)\n\nThe VirtualVault operating system is HP's solution to secure\nelectronic commerce. It is a B1 and B2 DoD compliant system\nthat is becoming increasingly popular with big business, banks, etc., \nThe main security mechanism in which VVOS is based upon is data partitioning. \nData on the system is classified into one of four security classes, or 'vaults' ...\n\nWhile the TGP daemon does a good job of ensuring the integrity of the\nrequest prior to forwarding data to its destination, the trusted\ngateway agent that is responsible for wrapping CGI requests does not\ncheck the length of the request prior to sending it to TGP. This poses\na problem since TGA does not correctly handle request messages that \nare more than 512 bytes in length. The result is a trivial DoS attack on\nTGA and all services being wrapped by TGA. The bug was discovered during a\npenetration test on a client system running VVOS 3.01. A post was made to\na CGI application residing on the system with a large string of characters.\nThis was then sent to the trusted gateway agent, causing the daemon \nto crash, leaving the Netscape Enterprise Server unable to service further\nHTTP/SSL requests.\n",
