  "Description": "\"default\" sendmail\nconfiguration setup which came with 8.6.9 with a .m4 file I\napparently have lost but which basically says \"use the DNS and\nSMTP\".  From reading the generated config file it would seem that\nwhat is causing this to happen is the existence of the\nmailertable lookup, and in particular this line:\n\nR< $- : $+ > $*         $# $1 $@ $2 $: $3               check -- resolved?\n\nwhich apparently can be tricked into choosing the mailer to use\nbased on data given by an external party.  The person discovering\nthis problem (Tor Egge, in the CC line) came up with the fix to\nproto.m4 attached below as the second attachment, but it is not\ncertain that this fix plugs all the remaining holes in this area.",
