  "Description": "df(1) is a program used to display statistics about the amount of used\nand free disc space on file systems.\n\nDue to insufficient bounds checking on arguments which are supplied\nby users, it is possible to overwrite the internal stack space of the\ndf program while it is executing.  By supplying a carefully designed\nargument to the df program, intruders may be able to force df to\nexecute arbitrary commands.  As df is setuid root, this may allow\nintruders to run arbitrary commands with root privileges.\n\n\nSilicon Graphics Inc. acknowledges the df buffer overrun vulnerability\npublically reported by several individuals and in AUSCERT Advisory AA-97.19.\n\nCurrently, Silicon Graphics Inc. is investigating and no further information\nis available for public release at this time.\n\nAs further information becomes available, additional advisories will be\nissued via the normal SGI security information distribution methods\nincluding the wiretap mailing list.",

  "Workarounds": "1. Remove setuid perms, and execute perms from df. % chmod u-s `which df` 2. Use the AUSCERT wrapper The source for the wrapper, including installation instructions, can\nbe found at: ftp://ftp.auscert.org.au/pub/auscert/tools/overflow_wrapper/overflow_wrapper.c An extract from AA-97.19.IRIX.df.buffer.overflow.vul: This wrapper replaces the df program and checks the length of the command line arguments which are passed to it. If an argument exceeds a certain predefined value (MAXARGLEN), the wrapper exits without executing the df command. The wrapper program can also be configured to syslog any failed attempts to execute df with arguments exceeding MAXARGLEN. For further instructions on using this wrapper, please read the comments at the top of overflow_wrapper.c. When compiling overflow_wrapper.c for use with df, AUSCERT recommends defining MAXARGLEN to be 32.",
