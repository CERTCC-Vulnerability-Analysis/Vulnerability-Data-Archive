Likewise, any applications that appear several times in the list should also be considered highly suspect as the hostile application may attempt to disguise itself as a well-known application.",

  "Overview": "Zone Alarm is a personal firewall application. It contains a feature called \"automatic intrusion blocking\" to prohibit applications from accessing the internet without prior approval from the user. Due to the way that Zone Alarm Pro notifies the user of an application's attempt to access the internet, a malicious program can take actions on behalf of the user with out the user's knowledge, and allow itself to access the internet.",
