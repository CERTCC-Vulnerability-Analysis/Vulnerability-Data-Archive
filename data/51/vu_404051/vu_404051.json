  "Description": "The Dell SonicWALL service bulletin states: \"After the release of Dell SonicWALL Scrutinizer 9.5.0, we received a report of an issue whereby a Scrutinizer user who had already authenticated to the product could manipulate a certain URL to run SQL commands against the Scrutinizer database. Error output was also displayed which provided debug information detailing the query being run. While the risk to most Scrutinizer installations was low, we decided to proactively publish a patched update to fix this vulnerability in the form of Scrutinizer 9.5.2.\" Additional details may be found in the full Dell SonicWALL service bulletin.
