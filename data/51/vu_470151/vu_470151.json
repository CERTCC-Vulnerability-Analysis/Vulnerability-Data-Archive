  "Description": "/proc/<pid>/mem is an interface for reading and writing to process memory. The protections to protect unprivileged users from writing to process memory were found to be insufficient and have resulted in exploitation of the interface. By writing to the memory of a suid process, an attacker can run arbitrary code with root privileges. Further technical details can be found on Jason A. Donenfeld's ZX2C4 blog post.",

Users who obtain the Linux kernel from a third-party vendor, such as their operating system vendor, should see the vendor information portion of this document for a partial list of affected vendors.",
