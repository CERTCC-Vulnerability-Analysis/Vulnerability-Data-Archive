  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access Restricting access to 500/udp on vulnerable devices will provide some protection, however UDP traffic is relatively easy to spoof, and legitimate clients require access to 500/udp in order to use ISAKMP. Disable Debug According to the Cisco advisory, if debug is enabled, a VPN 3000 series concentrator is vulnerable to additional types of ISAKMP packets. Disable debug to prevent some types of ISAKMP packets from affecting a vulnerable device. Note that this is an incomplete solution. Disabling debug will not prevent other types of ISAKMP packets from causing a vulnerable device to reload.",
