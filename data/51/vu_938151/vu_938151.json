  "Description": "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are used to improve website performance and scalability by connecting a user to geographically nearby server for content. CDNs typically operate in two modes, a \"push\" mode allowing a user to upload content to the CDN for later distribution, or a \"pull\" mode which effectively acts as a reverse proxy. In some scenarios, a malicious user can manipulate \"pull mode\" forwarding to forward in an internal loop within the CDN. This effectively launches a denial of service (DoS) attack against the CDN by consuming large amounts of resources. More information is provided in the researcher's conference paper.",

  "Resolution": "The researchers and CERT have reached out to known affected CDNs to inform them of this attack. CDNs are implementing their own counter-measures to this attack. If you are an employee of a CDN, the CERT/CC encourages you to review the researcher's conference paper to determine if your CDN may be impacted.",
