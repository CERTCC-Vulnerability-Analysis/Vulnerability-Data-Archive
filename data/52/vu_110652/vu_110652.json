  "Description": "CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') The iPass Open Mobile Windows Client versions 2.4.4 and earlier utilizes named pipes for interprocess communication. One of the subprocesses spawned by the client runs with SYSTEM privileges. An authenticated user can register arbitrary DLL files, including ones located at UNC paths, by sending a specially-crafted unicode string to this subprocess to one of the named pipes. The DllMain function in the specified DLL file will then execute with SYSTEM privileges.",
