  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Use the nv driver\nDisable the NVIDIA-supplied driver in favor of the \"nv\" driver that is included by default with many X distributions. Note that implementing this workaround will result in loss of performance and features, since the nv driver does not provide access to the accelerated 3D features of the video adapter. Upgrade to the latest beta version of the driver\nThe latest beta version of the driver for Unix systems (Version: 1.0-9625) does not appear to contain this vulnerability. More information can be found on the NVIDIA BETA Drivers download page. Users may wish to upgrade to this version until an official release can be obtained from the vendor.",
