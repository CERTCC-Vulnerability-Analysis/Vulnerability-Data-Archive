  "Description": "Two sites have independently reported being compromised via sshd, namely rotshell and uunet.  Both reports claim that the compromised machine was accessible only via ssh; both\nreports indicate that the intruder carefully erased their tracks; both sites are reasonably well-informed about security issues; both sites were running sshd version 1.2.26, which is the most recent free version; neither report has any solid evidence that ssh was in fact\nthe culprit, except that both insist that ssh was the only active network service at the time of the compromise. \n\nOne of the sites suggests that the gmp 2.02 library may have a\nvulnerability; gmp is used with ssh.",

  "References": "http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,28043,00.html?st.ne.1.head, From Rootshell: , On Wed Oct 28th at 5:12AM PST the main Rootshell page was defaced by a group of crackers. Entry to the machine was made via SSH (secure shell) which is an encrypted interface to the machine at 04:57AM PST this morning. Rootshell was first informed of this incident at 6:00 AM PST and the site was immediately brought offline. The site was back up and operational by 8:00AM PST.,  We are still in the process of investigating the exact methods that were used. The paranoid MAY want to disable ssh 1.2.26. Rootshell runs Linux 2.0.35, ssh 1.2.26, qmail 1.03, Apache 1.3.3 and nothing else. The attackers used further filesystem corruption to make it harder to remove the damaged HTML files., More information about SSH may be found at http://www.ssh.fi/sshprotocols2/index.html , rootshell.com - Archive of defaced site. , Information about the client-side buffer overflow: , http://rootshell.com/archive-j457nxiqi3gq59dv/199811/sshkerb.txt.html",
