  "Description": "The buffer overflow root exploit \"irix-printers.c\" posted to bugtraq May\n1997 appears not to have been patched yet.  The description listed with the\ncode at www.rootshell.com is \"This will overwrite a buffer in\n/usr/sbin/printers on IRIX systems giving root.\"  This piece of code is a\nbuffer overrun which apparently SGI has not taken care of yet or is not\naware of and I haven't located an AUSCERT, CERT, or SGI advisory covering\nit.\n\nIn particular this exploit works against a Indigo2 running Irix 6.2 loaded\nwith the latest SGI application CD-ROM and patched with SGI's January 1,\n1998 patchset and the following additonal security patches: 2090, 2133,\n2177, 2213, 2564, 2580.  Security patches 1417, 2414, and 2167 are not\ninstalled because they are for software versions earlier than what is\ninstalled on this system.  Printing Tools Software 1.7.2 is installed.",
