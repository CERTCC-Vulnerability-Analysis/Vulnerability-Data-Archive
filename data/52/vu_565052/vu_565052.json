  "Overview": "Passwords sent using SSH with RC4 encryption can be easily cracked by an attacker who is able to capture and replay the session. This problem occurs for three reasons: SSH sessions can be replayed, the RC4 encryption algorithm has some specific weaknesses, and the SSH daemon provides too much information during the authentication phase of the protocol.",
