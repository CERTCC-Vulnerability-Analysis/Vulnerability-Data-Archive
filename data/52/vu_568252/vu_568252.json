  "Description": "CWE-200: Information Exposure\nWhen logged into the Websense Triton Unified Security Center 7.7.3 and possibly earlier versions with any permission level, it is possible to navigate to the \u201cLog Database\u201d or \u201cUser Directories\u201d portions of the \u201cSettings\u201d module. In either section, it is possible to use a web browser to \u201cInspect Elements\u201d within the page. Password blocks are initially hashed within the page using the following form variable: <input type=\u201dpassword\u201d id=\u201dlogDatabaseSettings:password\u201d name =\u201dlogDatabaseSettings:password\u201d maxlength=\u201d50\u00b7 size=\u201d21\u00b7> However, due to the lack of proper form construction and hashing of password credentials, it is possible to change the string to the following and reload the page: <input type=\u201dtext\u201d id=\u201dlogDatabaseSettings:password\u201d name =\u201dlogDatabaseSettings:password\u201d maxlength=\u201d50\u00b7 size=\u201d21\u00b7> Allowing the password credentials to be displayed in plain-text, along with the associated username.",
