  "Impact": "Using specially crafted client certificate messages, a remote attacker can attempt to exploit underlying vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS ASN.1 parsing implementations. The impacts of these vulnerabilities (VU#935264, VU#255484, VU#380864, and VU#686224) are denial of service and possible execution of arbitrary code.",
