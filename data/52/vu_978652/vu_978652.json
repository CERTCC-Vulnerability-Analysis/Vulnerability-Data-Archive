  "Description": "CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data Bomgar Remote Support version 14.3.1 and possibly earlier versions deserialize untrusted data without sufficient validation. An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary input to at least one vulnerable PHP file, and authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary input to multiple vulnerable PHP files. When malicious data is deserialized, arbitrary PHP code may be executed in the context of the PHP server process.",
