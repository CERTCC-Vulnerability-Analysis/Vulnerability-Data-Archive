  "Description": "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CVE-2012-6273\nDuring the SHU request (search user) from the bigant messaging client, a sql query is built from a template and sent via a http like header. Proper sanitization is not performed. It has been reported this can be demonstrated by opening up the BigAnt Messenger Client, logging into a server, and searching for an 'Account/Full Name' of blah' OR hs_User.Col_Pword LIKE '[a-z] CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges - CVE-2012-6274\nArbitrary unauthenticated file upload in BigAnt IM Server. It has been reported that authentication for file uploads is not enforced. Uploaded files were reported to be saved to C:\\Program Files\\BigAntSoft\\AntServer\\DocData\\Public.

Note that restricting access does not prevent SQLi, unauthenticated file uploads, or denial of service attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host.
