The 1.93 release of majordomo does not\nhave this problem.\n\nThe hole can be taken advantage of by using the 'newconfig' command to\nput in place a new configuration file for the list containing a line\nin one of the 'regexp_array' type variables that will be immeadiately\nexecuted as the majordomo user.",
