  "Impact": "If the root user executes one of the vulnerable commands while a\nsymbolic link from the corresponding temporary file exists, then\nthe link will be followed and overwrite or create arbitrary system\nfiles. The vulnerable commands are not installed as set-user-id programs,\nthus, unpriviledged users cannot create files in system\ndirectories. However, the root user may be tricked into executing\nthe programs while the symbolic link is in place.",
