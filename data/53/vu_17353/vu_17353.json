  "Description": "From the ISS Advisory: \n\nInternet Security Systems (ISS) X-Force discovered a vulnerability in the\nBackWeb Technologies (http://www.backweb.com/home.html) BackWeb Polite\nAgent Protocol that allows a user on a local network on which BackWeb\nclients operate to spoof a BackWeb server.  Hardware and software vendors\noften include BackWeb software in their distribution to facilitate remote\ndistribution of software updates.\n\n...\n\nThe BackWeb Polite Agent Protocol is a UDP-based protocol that BackWeb\nclients use to communicate with BackWeb servers. BackWeb's \"anti-spoofing\nmechanism\" for delivery of UDP data to the client and server is the\nexchange of a 32-bit integer, randomly generated by the client each time\nit requests data from the server. This integer is appended to each packet\nof a specific piece of BackWeb data (InfoPak). By examining these packets\nin transport, an attacker may send false data to a BackWeb client, acting\nas the real BackWeb server.\n",
