  "Description": "IMAP clients may allow the user to specify CRAM-MD5 for authentication; unfortunately, they may fall back to plaintext authentication if CRAM-MD5 is not sucessful, thereby destroying any value that may be obtained from using a hashing authentication protocol. This happens without any error being raised.   The appropriate action in this situation is not covered in the RFC.\n\nThe products in question from the original report were Esys Simeon and Qualcomm Eudora.",
