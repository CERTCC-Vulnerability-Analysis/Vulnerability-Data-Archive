  "Description": "FROM Cisco Security Notice: Field Notice PIX Firewall Manager File Exposure\n\nThe Cisco PIX Firewall product is shipped with a management application\nknown as PIX Firewall Manager,  or PFM. PFM is a Worldwide-Web-based\napplication, and includes a limited HTTP server. The PFM HTTP server runs on\nWindows NT computers. A vulnerability in the PFM HTTP server allows any\nattacker who can connect to the server to retrieve any file known in advance\nto exist on the Windows NT host.  In almost all cases, this means that the\nhost is vulnerable to attack by any user inside the firewall, but not by\nusers outside the firewall.",

  "Resolution": "Use the PIX Device Manager instead of the PIX Firewall Manager (PFM). If that is not possible, upgrade to a version of PFM later than 4.2(1), or the latest version.",
