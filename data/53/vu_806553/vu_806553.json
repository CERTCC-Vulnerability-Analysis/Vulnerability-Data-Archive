  "Impact": "An attacker may be able to create files in the context of an application that uses a function that exposes the vulnerability. The scope of the impact depends on how the affected application works. Applications that process filename input from the network, such as some web applications, would be vulnerable to a remote attacker. Applications that only process filename input from a local user would only be vulnerable to a local attacker.",
