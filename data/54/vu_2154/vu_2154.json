  "Workarounds": "Fix: From the Firewall-1 Security Policy Window choose Properties from the Policy Menu. Uncheck the \"Accept Domain Name Queries (UDP)\" and \"Accept Domain Name Download (TCP)\". This will disable DNS which, of course, will cause problems. In order to avoid this you will need to create a specific rule in the rule base to allow these core protocols to function. The exact nature of this rule will vary depending on the configuration of DNS within your own network and the above steps should only be taken after consulting with in-house DNS administrators.",
