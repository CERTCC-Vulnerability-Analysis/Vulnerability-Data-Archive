  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. Since the IP stack is implemented as a kernel driver, an attacker who successfully executes arbitrary code could gain complete control of a vulnerable system. Kernel memory corruption caused by an attack could cause a vulnerable system to crash and possibly reboot.",
