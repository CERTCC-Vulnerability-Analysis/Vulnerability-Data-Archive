  "VendorStatement": "Overview\nBaramundi Management Suite versions 7.5 to 8.9 contains multiple \nvulnerabilities related to clear-text credential storage and transmission. Comment: All three reported observations are correct and legitimate. baramundi is going \nto continually improve in these areas and provides more specific details for \nthese issues enclosed. We have identified two concrete issues with need for immediate action and have \naddressed and improved these with the new baramundi management suite 2014 \n(short: bMS 2014). CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information - CVE-2013-3593\nBaramundi Management Suite versions 7.5 to 8.9 transfers data in clear text \nbetween the server and clients, and stores data in clear text. Vendor comment: Due to a protocol problem when negotiating communication \nchannels one side of the communication could be set up unencrypted. bMS 2014 \nresolves this problem. There are no clear text transfers in this main \ncommunication channels any more. In addition the server only accepts encrypted \nclient connections. This change has been implemented compatibly, i.e. even with \nolder agent versions the main communication channel is secured. This \nimprovement also has been implemented for the communication with the agent used \nwith Windows PE for OS installation. This also improves security while \ninstalling operating systems. CWE-312: Clear text Storage of Sensitive Information - CVE-2013-3624\nWhen Baramundi Management Suite versions 7.5 to 8.9 is used for OS deployment, \nit stores the credentials in an unencrypted form on the deployed systems. Vendor comment: This affects the files to configure the OS installation.\u00c2\u00a0 \nDepending on the chosen method to join domains, the administrator credentials \ncan reside in clear text (cf. Microsoft standard methods, \nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730845%28v=ws.10%29.aspx#BKMK_3). In the installed system this is part of the Microsoft process to automatically \ndeploy systems. bMS 2014 warns the administrator, if choosing an unsecured \nmethod. Access rights regarding OS installation have been further restricted on \nserver side. CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key - CVE-2013-3625\nBaramundi Management Suite versions 7.5 to 8.9 utilizes a hard-coded encryption \nkey stored in a dll file. Vendor comment: Yes, this is the way it is currently implemented. baramundi \nwill provide continuous improvements in this field. The mobile device \nmanagement module already uses a certificate based process.",
