  "Description": "A file creation problem exists within the dtlogin program.  The\nprogram creates the file /var/dt/Xerrors as a mode 666 file.\nFurthermore, when creating this file and /var/dt/Xpid, it follows\nsymlinks.\n\nBy symlinking these two files to sensitive configuration files and\nforcing a restart on dtlogin, it is possible to gain non-authorised\nwrite access over important files.  This allows a non-privileged\nuser to under some circumstances (such as having physical access to\nthe console) to gain priviliged access.  See the Exploit field\nbelow for an example.",
