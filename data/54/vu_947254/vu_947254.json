  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running the PAM. RealSecure and BlackICE products run on Microsoft Windows platforms with SYSTEM privileges. An Internet worm called \"Witty\" exploits this vulnerability in RealSecure and BlackICE products on Windows systems (Proventia products are not affected). The worm overwrites sections of the target system's hard drive, which could corrupt stored data and render the target system inoperable. For more information, please see the ISS Alert.",
