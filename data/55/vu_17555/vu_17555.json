  "Description": "A denail of service attack can be launched against FreeBSD systems.\nUsing a flaw in the interpreation of sequence numbers in the RST\npacket, malicious users can terminate connections of other users at\nwill.\n\nTCP/IP connections are controlled through a series of packets that are\nreceieved by the two computers involved in the connection.  Old, stale\nconnections are reset with a packet called a RST packet.  The RST\npackets have a sequence number in them that must be valid according to\ncertain rules in the standards.",
