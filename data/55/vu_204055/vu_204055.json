  "Description": "The Blackboard Transact application (previously know as Blackboard Commerce Suite) comes with a utility called BbtsConnection_Edit.exe that is used to edit the encrypted configuration file named connection.xml. When editing connection.xml, BbtsConnection_Edit.exe decrypts all the fields except the <Password> field. If a user opens the connection.xml file in text editor and copies the data for <Password> into any other field such as <Server>, then the BbtsConnection_Edit.exe program will display the password in the other field, in this example <Server>. An additional issue exists in that the Blackboard Transact application uses multiple script and batch (.bat) files for automated backup procedures that contain the database username and password in clear text.",
