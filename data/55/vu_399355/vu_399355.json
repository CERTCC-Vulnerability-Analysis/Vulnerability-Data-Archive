  "Impact": "Attackers that are on the local network segment can cause vulnerable Cisco routers or switches to crash causing network outages. It may also be possible for an attacker to masquerade as the disabled router and do anything the legitimate router could do with the traffic (including reading, sending, and receiving data).",

  "Workarounds": "Workaround\nThe following workaround is taken from the Cisco Security Advisory. Enter the router interface MAC address into the arp table with a configuration entry. This is sometimes known as \"hard coding\" the ARP table entry. The syntax for this command for routers and switches running IOS is as follows: arp <ip-address> <hardware-address> <type>\nThe syntax for this command for switches running CatOS is as follows: set arp [dynamic|permanent|static] <ip_address> <hardware_address> The caveat to this workaround is identified with defect CSCdv04366, which will clear all manually entered MAC addresses from the ARP table, when they are the same as the interface MAC address, when the command \"clear arp\" is issued on the router.\u00a0 This workaround does not survive a reboot of the router, and must be rewritten to the configuration after any reload or reboot.",
