  "Description": "There is a flaw in BIND 9.7.2 through 9.7.2-P1 where the wrong ACL is applied. This flaw could allow access to a cache via recursion even though the ACL disallowed it. This bug is primarily a risk to operators running both authoritative and recursive DNS on the same BIND server in the same view.",
