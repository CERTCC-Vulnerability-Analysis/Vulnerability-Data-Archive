  "Impact": "An attacker who is able to obtain the database credentials from one site can potentially access databases on other sites sharing the same credentials. The attacker may need access to the local network or a system with Dentrix G5 installed in order to obtain the credentials, and the attacker would need network access to the database in order to obtain sensitive patient information.",

  "Description": "Dentrix G5 has uses hard-coded credentials (CWE-798) to access a database back-end. The credentials are the same across installations of Dentrix G5. Sensitive patient information is contained in Dentrix G5 databases. An administrator is unable to change these credentials without breaking access to the back-end database. Henry Schein has provided a vendor statement with additional details about this vulnerability.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an Update Dentrix G5 version 15.1.294 (Dentrix G5.1 Hotfix 1, released 14 Feb 2013) addresses this vulnerability. This update adds a feature to create a unique database back-end password for each Dentrix G5 installation. The update also makes it more difficult to obtain the password from a Dentrix G5 system or the network. Contact Henry Schein customer service for additional information.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict Network Access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from using the hard-coded credentials from a blocked network location. Do not allow the Dentrix G5 database to be accessed by unauthorized users on an insecure wireless network. If the Dentrix G5 database is accessible from an insecure wireless network, a remote attacker may be able to gain access using the hard-coded credentials. Wireless access points should be configured to use WPA2 encryption and disable the WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) PIN. Encryption standards such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) can be easily cracked and should not be relied on to secure wireless networks.",
