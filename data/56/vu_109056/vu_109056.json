  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access to Trend Micro ServerProtect Until the patch can be applied you may wish to block access to the vulnerable software from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to the ports used by theTrend Micro ServerProtect  service (5168/tcp). This will limit your exposure to attacks. However, blocking at the network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. The use of host-based firewalls in addition to network-based firewalls can help restrict access to specific hosts within the network. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate.",
