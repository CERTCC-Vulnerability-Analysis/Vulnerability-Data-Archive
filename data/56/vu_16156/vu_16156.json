This will mean\nthat local and remote clients cannot access the X server\nwhich may inhibit some functionality for local users.\nIf that is a problem, an alternative is to use the X11\n\"MAGIC_COOKIE\" feature by setting\nDisplayManager*authorize:  on\nin /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config or in individual users'\nX configuration files.  Interested sites should refer\nto their X11 documentation for details - we don't have\na document on how to do this.",
