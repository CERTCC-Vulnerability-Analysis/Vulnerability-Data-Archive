  "Description": "The volrmmount program which is used for media volume control\n(i.e. not sound volumen control!) has an undocumented switch (-c)\nwhich can be used to specify an arbitrary configuration file.\nvolrmmount is a setuid root program.\n\nBecause vulnerable versions don't drop the euid of 0 appropriately,\nthis one problem allows two distinct behaviors to be exploited by\nan attacker.\n\nFirst problem: If the configuration file doesn't have the\nappropriate format, volrmmount prints out the lines that don't\nconform.  Therefore, by specifying a protected file (such as\n/etc/shadow) as the configuration file, volrmmount will display the\ncontents of that file to the user (who would not otherwise be able\nto see it).\n\nSecond problem:  The configuration file can specify arbitrary\nlibrary files.  By constructing a purpose built configuration file,\nwhich in turn specifies a purpose built library, an attacker is\nable to have volrmmount execute arbitrary code.  This is easily\nleveraged (see the exploit) to gain root access.",
