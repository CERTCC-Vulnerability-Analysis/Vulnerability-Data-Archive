  "Impact": "A remote attacker could cause the vulnerable system to stop responding, thereby resulting in a denial of service. Microsoft states that for Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 the attacker would need to be authenticated with valid user logon credentials in order to successfully carry out an attack on an affected system. On other affected platforms, the attacker would not need to be authenticated.",
