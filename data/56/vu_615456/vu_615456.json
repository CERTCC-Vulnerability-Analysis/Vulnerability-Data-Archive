  "Description": "CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - CVE-2016-2354 The CERT Coordination Center has determined that the Lemur BlueDriver does not require a PIN to connect to it via Bluetooth. This allows anyone within Bluetooth range to access standard OBD-II diagnostic information about the car, including gas mileage, Diagnostic Trouble codes, speed, emissions, etc. It also allows an attacker to create a serial connection directly to the CAN (Controller Area Network) bus in the vehicle. Any valid CAN command can be sent to the vehicle. Depending on the vehicle, this may allow attackers to affect safety critical systems such as steering or braking.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an Update\nLemur Vehicle Monitors has released a firmware update to address this vulnerability: BlueDriver scan tool users can update their sensor Firmware (F/W) by opening \ntheir BlueDriver App and tapping \u2018More\u2019 > \u2018Update Sensor F/W\u2019 > 'Check for \nUpdates' and following the instructions. The latest F/W for BlueDriver limits Bluetooth discoverability to 1 minute \nafter plug in. This added feature limits discovering (and then pairing) to \nyour BlueDriver to those who first plug in the sensor. For clarification, the vendor has stated that discoverability is now limited to only when the device is plugged in, not every time the vehicle is turned on.",

  "Overview": "The Lemur Vehicle Monitors BlueDriver is an aftermarket automotive device that connects to a vehicle's OBD-II port and provides information about the vehicle's performance. The BlueDriver does not require a PIN for Bluetooth access, which allows anyone in range to send arbitrary commands to the vehicle's CAN bus.",
