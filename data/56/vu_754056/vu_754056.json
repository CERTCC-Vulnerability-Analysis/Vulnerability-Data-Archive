  "Description": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password - CVE-2016-2362 According to the reporter,  FTP is used to sync phone configurations for users, by use of a hard-coded username and password. The default SSH server configuration allows the FTP user to also log in via SSH and obtain a shell as the 'nobody' user. CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment - CVE-2016-2363 According to the reporter, the script /var/www/rpc/surun has incorrect permissions, allowing the user 'nobody' to run many commands as root. CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key - CVE-2016-2364 According to the reporter, the HUDweb plugin for Google Chrome  contains a Thawte-signed SSL certificate and private key. This key is shared across all installations. The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2016-2363.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an update A patch addressing CVE-2016-2362 and CVE-2016-2363 in Fonality version 12.6 and above has been released. This patch is available via the automatic updates feature. Users of versions prior to version 12.6 are encouraged to upgrade to 12.6 or later as soon as possible. CVE-2016-2364 was partially addressed in a Webphone plugin update released on 2016 May 5, but still makes use of hard-coded cryptographic material and only notifies the user. On 20 December 2016, HUDweb 1.4.4 was released to address CVE-2016-2364. Users will be automatically upgraded when visiting HUDweb.fonality.com. Users are encouraged to update their plugin to latest available version of HUDweb, instead of Webphone. Affected users should also consider the following workarounds:",
