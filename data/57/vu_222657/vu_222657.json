  "Description": "RealFlex RealWin is a SCADA server package for medium and small applications designed to control and monitor real-time applications. The RealWin application runs an HMI service on port 912/tcp. This service is vulnerable to two stack-based buffer overflows. One vulnerability is caused by the use of sprintf() in the SCPC_INITIALIZE() and SCPC_INITIALIZE_RF() functions. The second vulnerability is caused by the use of strcpy() in the SCPC_TXTEVENT() function. Further information is available in ICS_CERT Advisory ICSA-10-313-01",
