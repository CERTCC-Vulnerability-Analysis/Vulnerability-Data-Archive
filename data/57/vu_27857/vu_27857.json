Since Access does not allow a user to disable VBA code embedded in Access data and project files, the CERT Coordination Center recommends that users follow the suggested workaround and set the Admin password even after the patch for this vulnerability has been applied.",

  "Overview": "Under certain conditions, Internet Explorer can open Microsoft Access database or project files containing malicious code and execute the code without giving a user prior warning. Access files that are referenced by OBJECT tags in HTML documents can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or macros. A patch which protects against all known variants of attack exploiting this vulnerability is now available. A workaround which was previously suggested provided protection against one specific publicly-available exploit using .mdb files but did not protect against attack using many other Access file types. (See below for a complete list of file types.) Last month, a workaround for the \"IE Script\" vulnerability was addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-049: Subsection \"Workaround for 'The IE Script' Vulnerability.\" Microsoft has just re-released MS00-049, which now includes information about a patch for this vulnerability. The CERT Coordination Center is issuing this document to raise awareness in the Internet community about the need to apply this patch to protect IE users against all variants of attacks which can exploit this particular vulnerability.",
