  "Workarounds": "Disable dynamic DNS updates (NSUPDATE) As an interim measure, the ISC recommends disabling the NSUPDATE feature on affected DHCP servers. Block external access to DHCP server ports As an interim measure, it is possible to limit exposure to these vulnerabilities by restricting external access to affected DHCP servers on the following ports: bootps      67/tcp      # Bootstrap Protocol Server\nbootps      67/udp      # Bootstrap Protocol Server\nbootpc      68/tcp      # Bootstrap Protocol Client\nbootpc      68/udp      # Bootstrap Protocol Client Disable the DHCP service As a general rule, the CERT/CC recommends disabling any service or capability that is not explicitly required. Depending on your network configuration, you may not need to use DHCP.",
