  "Workarounds": "Disable the Microsoft Agent ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer The vulnerable ActiveX controls can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs: {D45FD31B-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F} {F5BE8BD2-7DE6-11D0-91FE-00C04FD701A5} {4BAC124B-78C8-11D1-B9A8-00C04FD97575} {D45FD31D-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F} {D45FD31E-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{D45FD31B-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{F5BE8BD2-7DE6-11D0-91FE-00C04FD701A5}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{4BAC124B-78C8-11D1-B9A8-00C04FD97575}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{D45FD31D-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{D45FD31E-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\nUnregister AgentSvr.exe The Microsoft Agent ActiveX controls interact with the Microsoft Agent Server (AgentSvr.exe) to provide Agent functionality. The Microsoft Agent Server can be unregistered to mitigate this vulnerability by running the following command: %windir%\\msagent\\agentsvr.exe /unregserver\nDisable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document.\u00a0",
