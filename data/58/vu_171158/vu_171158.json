  "Description": "CWE-200: Information Exposure\nLinkedIn contains an information exposure vulnerability. When a user receives an invitation and clicks on \"Ignore\", \"Accept\", or on the navigation bar menu, LinkedIn sends an unencrypted HTTP request that exposes authentication and session credentials. A remote attacker may be able to monitor this traffic and see the credentials over the wire. Because bscookie is not flagged as HTTPOnly and Secure, an attacker can override these flags which may cause persistent exposure of the authentication cookie.",
