  "Workarounds": "Reject data connections from hosts that do not match the control connection host One possible mitigation strategy is to reject data connections that do not originate from the same IP address as the control connection, but this has several problems. First, it makes the server not strictly compliant with RFC 959. Second, it can be defeated by an attacker on the same machine (or network, if spoofed IP addresses are used). Use randomly selected PASV ports to decrease likelihood of interception If the server chooses the PASV listening port randomly, it will be difficult or impossible for an attacker to determine the data port. Note that this will not protect against attackers who are able to intercept the FTP control connection because the FTP server must supply the PASV listening port to the client.",
