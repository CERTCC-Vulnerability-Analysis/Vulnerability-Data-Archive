  "Impact": "An attacker who exploits this vulnerability can monopolize the CPU of a FireWall-1 firewall, rendering it incapable of processing any incoming or outgoing traffic. Attackers are not able to pass packets or fragments that would be filtered out under normal circumstances, nor are they able to gain privileged access to the firewall or its host system.",

  "Resolution": "From Checkpoint: \"Check Point is in the process of building new kernel binaries that will modify the mechanism by which fragment events are written to the host system console, as well as providing configurable options as to how often to log. In addition and independent of the console message writing, with the new binaries FireWall-1 administrators will be able use the Check Point log file method for reporting fragmentation events. These binaries will be released shortly in Service Pack 2 of FireWall-1 version 4.1, for 4.1 users, and as a Service Pack 6 Hot Fix for FireWall-1 version 4.0 users.\"",
