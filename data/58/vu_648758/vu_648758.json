  "Impact": "By convincing a user to view an HTML document (e.g., a web page), an attacker could execute arbitrary commands or code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could take any action as the user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the user's system. Note that Mozilla Firefox enables by default a \"whitelist\" feature for XPInstall. This means that an attacker must have control of a site listed in the whitelist to successfully exploit this vulnerability. The default sites in the whitelist are addons.mozilla.org and update.mozilla.org. Several changes have been made to these sites to help prevent an attacker from using these sites for exploitation.",
