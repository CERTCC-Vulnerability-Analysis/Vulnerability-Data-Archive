  "Impact": "By causing an application to process a specially-crafted file with the Autonomy Keyview IDOL library, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause an affected application to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Depending on what application is using Keyview IDOL, these may happen as the result of some user interaction, such as single-clicking on a file, or it may happen with no user interaction at all.",

  "Description": "Autonomy Keyview IDOL is a set of libraries that can decode over 1,000 different file formats. The Autonomy Keyview IDOL libraries are used by a variety of applications, including IBM Lotus Notes, Lotus Domino, Symantec Mail Security, Hyland OnBase, and many others. These vulnerabilities result from a number of underlying issues. Some of these cases demonstrated memory corruption with attacker-controlled input and could be exploited to run arbitrary code. For example, code execution was verified by CERT/CC for a stack buffer overflow in the .WRI file parser.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an Update Autonomy has released version 10.13.1 of Keyview IDOL to address these issues. Autonomy customers can download the update from Autonomy's Customer Support website. The following versions of Symantec products have been released to address these vulnerabilities. Symantec customers may retrieve these versions through their normal support methods. Symantec Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange 6.5.6 or 6.0.13\nSymantec Mail Security for Domino 7.5.12 or 8.0.9\nSymantec Brightmail and Messaging Gateway 9.5.1\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention 11.1.1\nIf you are unable to apply an update to address these vulnerabilities please consider the following workarounds.",

  "Workarounds": "Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit The Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this and other vulnerabilities. Enable DEP in Microsoft Windows Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but it can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts \"Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology\" part 1 and part 2. DEP should be used in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document. Note that when relying on DEP for exploit mitigation, it is important to use a system that supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as well. ASLR is not supported by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or earlier. ASLR was introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Please see the Microsoft SRD blog entry: On the effectiveness of DEP and ASLR for more details. Workaround for IBM Lotus Notes Delete the keyview.ini file in the Notes program directory (C:\\ProgramData\\Lotus\\Notes\\Data\\Shared). This disables ALL viewers. When a user clicks View (for any file attachment), a dialog box will display with the message \"Unable to locate the viewer configuration file.\" Delete or rename the affected DLL file. After removing the dll file, when a user tries to view a file that requires that viewer, a dialog box will display with the message \"The viewer display window could not be initialized.\" All other file types work without returning the error message. Comment out lines in keyview.ini that reference affected DLL file. To comment a line, you precede it with a semi-colon (;). When a user tries to view the specific file type, a dialog box will display with the message \"The viewer display window could not be initialized.\" [KVWKBVE] --> this is the section of the keyview.ini\n;188=xlssr.dll ---> this would be the result of the Excel dll commented out Workaround for Symantec Mail Security Symantec Mail Security is susceptible only if the attachment content scanning option is enabled. To disable the content filtering rules for Symantec Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange: Select the \"Policies\" tab and then choose \"Content Filtering\" to display the list of currently enabled rules\nEnsure that all rules using attachment content are \"disabled\"\nTo disable the content filtering rules for Symantec Mail Security for Domino: Select the \"Content Filtering\" tab to display the list of current enabled rules\nClick on the checkmark to the left of any rules that utilize attachment content filtering, changing it to a red \"X\", and disabling the rule",
