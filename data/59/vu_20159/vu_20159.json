  "Description": "I eventually narrowed the problem down to the first message in the\nemployee's POP3 inbox on our LAN's mail server.  The message contained\na \"Reply-to:\" header line with no address; i.e.:\n\nReply-to:\n\nI modified this header line by adding an address to it, and after I did\nthis, the employee was able to pick up the message (and all subsequent\nmessages) without difficulty.\n\nWe subsequently duplicated the same scenario under Exchange 4.0, so I'm\nguessing that the bug has passed unnoticed for some time.  Thankfully,\nmost e-mail clients don't generate malformed headers, which is probably\nwhy we haven't seen this problem before now.\n\nIt appears that messages in the user's inbox =before= the malformed\nmessage can be picked up OK.  However, messages in the inbox =after=\nthe malformed message cannot be retrieved.  Apparently, once Outlook\nor Exchange runs into the problem, it stops trying to read any more\nmail and quits the POP3 session.  This facet of the problem permits it\nto be used in a denial-of-service attack -- made all the worse by the\nwholly misleading nature of the error message, which may prompt the\nvictim's ISP to conclude it's a resource problem on the user's machine\nand wash their hands of the matter.",
