  "Impact": "Microsoft states the impact as follows: \"An attacker who was able to successfully exploit this vulnerability could cause the application running on the web server to restart. In addition, while Microsoft has not been able to demonstrate it, there is the possibility that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause code to run on the web server. The code could run in the security context of the ASP.NET worker process, which uses an unprivileged account by default\".",
