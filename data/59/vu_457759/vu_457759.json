  "Description": "CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow - CVE-2015-7547 According to a Google security blog post: \"The glibc DNS client side resolver is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when the getaddrinfo() library function is used. Software using this function may be exploited with attacker-controlled domain names, attacker-controlled DNS servers, or through a man-in-the-middle attack.\" According to glibc developers, the vulnerable code was initially added in May 2008 as part of the development for glibc 2.9. All versions from 2.9 (originally released November 2008) to 2.22 appear to be affected. More details and analysis are available in the patch announcement from glibc developers.",
