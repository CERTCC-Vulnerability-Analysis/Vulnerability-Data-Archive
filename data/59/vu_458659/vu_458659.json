  "Impact": "Attackers able to successfully predict the query id of DNS requests initiated by client systems would be able to corrupt DNS responses and potentially misdirect network traffic and mislead victims. This could result in identity masquerading, loss of confidential information, denial of service, and other impacts typically associated with DNS cache corruption (cache pollution) or domain name information spoofing.",
