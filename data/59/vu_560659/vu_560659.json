  "Overview": "Web Servers that use the IBM WebSphere Java Servlet Container 3.5 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A web site may inadvertently include malicious HTML tags or script(JavaScript, VBScript, Java, etc.) in a dynamically generated page based on unvalidated input from untrustworthy sources. This can be a problem when a web server does not adequately ensure that generated pages are properly encoded to prevent unintended execution of scripts, and when input is not validated to prevent malicious HTML from being presented to the user.",
