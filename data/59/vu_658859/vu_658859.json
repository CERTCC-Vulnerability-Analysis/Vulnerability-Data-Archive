  "Overview": "The Juniper JUNOS Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE)  leaks memory when certain IPv6 packets are submitted for processing. If an attacker submits multiple packets to a vulnerable router running IPv6-enabled  PFE, the router can be repeatedly rebooted, essentially creating a denial of service for the router.",
