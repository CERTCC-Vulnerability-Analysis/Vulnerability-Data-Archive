Additionally: <ul> <li> The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages. <li> Pictures become attachments to avoid loss of message content.</li> <li> Because the message is still in Rich Text Format or in HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly because the message is still in Rich Text Format or in HTML format in the mail store.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
