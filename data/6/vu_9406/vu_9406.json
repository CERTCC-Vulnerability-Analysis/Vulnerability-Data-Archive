  "Description": "There is a denial of service vulnerability in inetd distributed in SunOS versions up to and including 4.1.1B. Unprivliged users can execute inetd but can not bind to any of the protected ports < 1024, read memory, or preform any other operations which require root privliges; therefore, incoming requests will attempt to communicate with inetd, which will fail to\nbind services to privliged ports. This can occour even if another inetd is already resident. The most recently started server gets all of the requests.",
