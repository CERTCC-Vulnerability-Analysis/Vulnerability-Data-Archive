  "Description": "From Microsoft per ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postSP3/getadmin-fix/Q146965.txt\n\nA utility, Getadmin.exe, is being circulated on the Internet that\ngrants normal users administrative rights by adding them to the\nAdministrators group. This utility can be run from any user context\nexcept Guest and grants a local user account administrative rights.\n\nGetadmin.exe works because of a problem in a low-level kernel\nroutine that causes a global flag to be set which allows calls to\nNtOpenProcessToken to succeed regardless of the current users\npermissions. This in turn allows a user to attach to any process\nrunning on the system, including a process running in the system's\nsecurity context, such as WinLogon. Once attached to such a\nprocess, a thread can be started in the security context of the\nprocess.\n\nIn the specific case of GetAdmin, it attaches to the WinLogon\nprocess, which is running in the system's security context, and\nmakes standard API calls that add the specified user to the\nadministrators group.\n\nIt is important to note that any account which has been granted the\nrights to \"Debug Programs\" will always be able to run Getadmin.exe\nsuccessfully, even after the application of the hotfix. This is\nbecause the \"Debug Programs\" right allows a user to attach to any\nprocess. The \"Debug Programs\" right is initially granted to\nAdministrators and should be only granted to fully trusted users.\n\nAlso, if Getadmin.exe is run with an account that is already a\nmember of the administrators local group, it will still work (even\nafter applying the hotfix). This is by design. Members of the\nadministrators group always have the rights to make the calls\nGetAdmin needs in order to succeed.",
