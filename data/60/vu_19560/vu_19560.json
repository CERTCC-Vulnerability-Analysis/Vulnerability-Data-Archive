  "Description": "After recongnizing the command prefix (escape) character ``~'' sent\nfrom the terminal, /usr/bin/tip collects command arguments by a\nfunction prompt().  Since prompt() does not check the bounds, it is\npossible to cause a buffer overflow.  As tip is setuid uucp, this\nvulnerability may be exploited by local users to gain uucp\nprivileges, and then root privileges by forging in.uucpd, which is\nowned by uucp and can be invoked by inetd with root privileges.",
