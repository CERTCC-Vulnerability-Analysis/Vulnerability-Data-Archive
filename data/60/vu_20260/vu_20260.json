  "Description": "The Info Explorer daemon on AIX does not validate any of its arguments. By supplying a false UID and GID and a false environment, local users can cause infod to open ax X connection to their display; the connection will be running under the privileges of the UID supplied by the intruder. \n\nFurther, the program allows the user to supply an arbitrary command string to be used as the print command. By supplying somehitng like /bin/sh as the print command, intruders can gain privileged access. ",
