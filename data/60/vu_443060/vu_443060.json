We then try to do something with the uninitialized memory and crash in the interpreter.\" Note that proof of concept code that demonstrates issue this is publicly available.",

This will still allow JavaScript to run, but it will disable the TraceMonkey performance enhancements. Use NoScript Using the Mozilla Firefox NoScript extension to whitelist web sites that can run scripts will help to mitigate this vulnerability. Further details for configuring NoScript are available in the Securing Your Web Browser document. Disable JavaScript For instructions on how to disable JavaScript in Firefox, please refer to the Firefox section of the Securing Your Web Browser document.",
