  "Description": "The problem is that streams messages can be sent that are ZERO\nbytes in length.  These zero length messages don't flow contol, as\nflow control is based on the sum of the length of all messages on\nthe queue. Zero + zero is... ah...\n\nAt least two methods exist for creating these zero byte messages...\nOne is to send zero bytes messages directly, another is to send\n^D's to ldterm which converts them to zero bytes messages...\n\nAlso, a user could simply telnet to a system, execute '/bin/sleep\n10000', and then lean on the ctrl-d key, each keystroke will\nconsume a buffer..",
