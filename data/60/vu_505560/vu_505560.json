  "Description": "The Accellion File Transfer appliance contains multiple vulnerabilities in versions below FTA_9_12_40. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CVE-2016-2350\nThe Accellion File Transfer Appliance versions below contains three cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML content (including script) within the following: move_partition_frame.html\ngetimageajax.php\nwmInfo.html CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CVE-2016-2351\nThe Accellion File Transfer Appliance contains a SQL injection vulnerability due to improper escaping of the parameter \u2018client_id\u2019 in `/home/seos/courier/security_key2.api, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code in \u2018client_id,\u201d and recover private data. CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')- CVE-2016-2352\nThe Accellion File Transfer Appliance is vulnerable to command injection due to unsafe handling of restricted users utilizing the YUM_CLIENT. This allows a restricted user to execute any command via root permission. CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions - CVE-2016-2353\nThe Accellion File Transfer Appliance is vulnerable to local privilege escalation due to a misconfiguration. By default, the appliance allows a restricted user to add their SSH key to an alternate user group with additional permissions.",
