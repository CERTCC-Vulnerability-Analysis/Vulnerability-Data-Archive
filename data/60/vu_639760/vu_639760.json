Block or Restrict Access\nBlock or restrict access to the port used by WU-FTPD, typically 21/tcp. It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or a similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall may be able to filter requests made to WU-FTPD. Note that potential exploit strings would be transmitted from 113/tcp on clients to the WU-FTPD server that requested RFC 931 authentication. Disable Vulnerable Service\nDisable WU-FTPD until a patch can be applied.",
