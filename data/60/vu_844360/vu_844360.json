  "Overview": "The DNS stub resolver library in ISC BIND 4.9.2 through 4.9.10 contains buffer overflows in code that handles responses for network name and address requests. Other resolver libraries derived from BIND 4 such as BSD libc, GNU glibc, and those used by System V UNIX systems may also be affected. An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application that made the request or cause a denial of service.",
