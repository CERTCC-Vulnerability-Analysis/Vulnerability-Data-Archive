  "Workarounds": "Problem #1 Solution NeXT owners running Release 1.0 or 1.0a should remove\n/usr/etc/restore0.9 from all disks. This file is installed by the\n\"BuildDisk\" application, so it should be removed from all systems\nbuilt with the standard release disk, as well as from the standard\nrelease disk itself (which will prevent the file from being installed\non system built with the standard release disk in the future). You\nmust be root to remove this script, and the command that will remove\nthe script is the following: Problem #2 Solution NeXT computer owners running Release 1.0 or 1.0a should do two things\nto fix a potential security problem. First, the binary\n/usr/lib/NextPrinter/npd must be replaced with a more secure\nversion. This more secure version of npd is available through your\nNeXT support center. Upon receiving a copy of the more secure npd, you\nmust become root and install it in place of the old one in\n/usr/lib/NextPrinter/npd. The new npd binary needs to be installed\nwith the same permission bits (6755) and owner (root) as the old npd\nbinary. The commands to install the new npd binary are the following: # /bin/mv /usr/lib/NextPrinter/npd /usr/lib/NextPrinter/npd.old\n# /bin/mv newnpd /usr/lib/NextPrinter/npd (In the above command, \"newnpd\" is the npd binary that you obtained\nfrom your NeXT support center.) # /etc/chown root /usr/lib/NextPrinter/npd\n# /etc/chmod 6755 /usr/lib/NextPrinter/npd\n# /etc/chmod 440 /usr/lib/NextPrinter/npd.old The second half of the fix to this potential problem is to change the\npermissions of directories on the system that are currently owned and\nable to be written by group \"wheel\". The command that will remove\nwrite permission for directories owned and writable by group \"wheel\"\nis below. This command is all one line, and should be run as root. # find / -group wheel ! -type l -perm -20 ! -perm -2 -ls -exec chmod\ng-w {} \\; -o -fstype nfs -prune",
