  "Description": "Sending carefully crafted traffic to the telnet port will cause a\ndenial of service on telnet.  This is because of the operating\nsystem's practice of trusting and assuming that data arriving from\nthe net would meet certain criteria.\n\nIf an attacker establishes a telnet connection to a remote machine,\nand then sends a flood of ^D characters through this connection,\nthis causes the remote machine to suffer dramatically decreased\nperformance.",
