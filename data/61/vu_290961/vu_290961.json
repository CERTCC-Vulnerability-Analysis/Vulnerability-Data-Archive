  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service condition on a vulnerable system by introducing a specially crafted ICO file. The affected application would crash with a \"division by zero\" error. In the case of Windows Explorer, simply having the file on the desktop or any other location that is displayed by Explorer is enough to trigger the vulnerability.",

  "Workarounds": "Do not open untrusted files Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected files, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. It may be possible for a malformed ICO file to be embedded in an executable or other file. Please see Cyber Security Tip ST04-010. Do not follow unsolicited links In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting.",
