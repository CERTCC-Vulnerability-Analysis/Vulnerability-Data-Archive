  "Description": "                        NIS/YP Vulnerabilities\n\nSome of the attacks require knowing the site's domainname.  This can\noften be guessed by intruders:\n\n     1) Many sites use a domainname which is easy to guess\n        (e.g. their Internet domain name).  Showmount -e can also give hints.\n\n     2) If diskless clients are supported by NIS, the domainname\n        can be found by exploiting the bootparam protocol.\n        The only information required is the name of a\n        bootparam server and the name of a diskless client.\n\nYpserv vulnerabilities:\n\n     1) NIS maps (including passwd.* maps) are world readable. Any\n        user on an Internet host running NIS can access the NIS maps\n        from another NIS server if the domainname is known.\n\n        The maps can be read in two ways:\n           directly:  Using ypcat (ypserv can check origin of call).\n\n           indirectly:  via the portmapper.\n                This method accesses the portmapper directly and\n                bypasses ypserv so the origin of the call cannot be\n                verified.  Knowledge of the protocol is required to\n                exploit this method.  Ports can be probed to establish\n                which are in use by the portmapper.\n\n          Consequence:  NIS passwd maps can be obtained by remote users.\n                Publicly available password guessing\n                programs can then be used to guess passwords\n                for the domain.\n\n     2) Any root user on an Internet host running NIS can access the\n        secure NIS maps from another NIS server if the domainname\n        is known. Thus shadow password maps can be accessed remotely.\n\n        Consequence:  Secure NIS shadow passwd maps can be obtained by\n                root on remote systems.  Publicly available password\n                guessing programs can then be used to guess passwords\n                for the domain.\n\nYpxfrd vulnerabilities:\n   Most programs call ypxfrd with the help of ypserv, but the bugs\n   can also be exploited by calling ypxfrd directly.\n\n     1) Any NIS maps, including secure maps (shadow passwords) can\n        be read by any user on an Internet host running NIS. Again,\n        the domainname must be known.  This method results in a\n        dump of data containing the map being transferred to\n        the remote system via the tcp port or the portmapper directly.\n\n        Consequence:  Secure NIS shadow passwd maps can be obtained by\n        any user on remote systems.  Publicly available password\n        guessing programs can then be used to guess passwords for the domain.\n\n     2) Any DBM file can be read without checking the domainname\n        (e.g., the map \"history\" can be retrieved in the domain\n        \"../../usr/lib/news\").  That is, any DBM (*.{pag,dir}) file on\n        the system can be read from anywhere.\n        Such files may contain site-sensitive data.\n\n    Both ypserv and ypxfrd need to ensure that the files being\n    accessed are actually within the NIS root directory.\n\nYpbind vulnerabilities:\n\n     1) Some systems allow ypbind to be reset by any local user or even\n        from any remote system with a command such as:\n\n                ypset -d domainname -h target_host your_server\n\n        This allows attackers to substitute their own mapping files\n        for authentication, hostname translation, etc.  Simply requiring\n        that the user at a remote system be root is no protection\n        if the remote system is under the control of the attacker.",
