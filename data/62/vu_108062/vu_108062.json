  "Description": "CWE-620: Unverified Password Change - CVE-2013-6032\nCertain models of Lexmark laser printers and MarkNet devices are vulnerable to an attack which allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to change the administrative password of the printer's web administration interface. The interface does not perform sufficient validation of the vac.255.GENPASSWORD parameter in POST requests to the /cgi-bin/postpf/cgi-bin/dynamic/config/config.html page, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to reset the administrative password to an empty string. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CVE-2013-6033\nCertain models of Lexmark laser printers are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting attacks. The printers' administrative web interface does not perform sufficient validation of user input to the \"Location\" and \"Contact Name\" fields in the \"General Settings\" configuration page. A list of affected models and firmware versions can be found at Lexmark's advisory page. The CVSS score reflects CVE-2013-6032.",
