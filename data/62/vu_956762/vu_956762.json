  "Resolution": "Upgrade \nVersion 6.0.2 corrects this vulnerability. According to ESi: This vulnerability has been addressed in version 6.0.2 for ASP pages using the file saving mechanism in WebEOC. The file upload mechanism now checks the file size before storing the file data in the database as a binary object, limiting the total amount of data that may be uploaded into WebEOC. In an upcoming version of WebEOC this mitigation technique will be expanded to include other potential vulnerabilities. To obtain WebEOC upgrades, contact ESi Technical Support.",
