  "Description": "Tenable Network Security has reported that HP's fix for the command injection vulnerability, EDB-ID 18893, was incomplete. The ping command for the appliance has a total of four parameters. The initial fix has only sanitized the input for one of the four parameters. Command injection is still possible against the other three parameters.",
