  "Description": "1. INSECURE AUTHENTICATION TOKEN GENERATION: When a user (or administrator) logs on, the application sets predictable authentication token/cookie values. This can allow an attacker to bypass authentication checks and escalate privileges. 2. WEAK DEFAULT PASSWORDS: The default administrator password is weak and easily brute forced. Siemens has changed the documentation to encourage users to change the password at first login. 3. CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING VULNERABILITIES: SIMATIC HMI Smart Options web server is vulnerable to two separate cross-site scripting attacks that may allow elevation of privileges, data theft, or service disruption. 4. HEADER INJECTION VULNERABILITY: The HMI web server is vulnerable to header injection that may allow elevation of privileges, data theft, or service disruption. 5. CLIENT\u2013SIDE ATTACK VIA SPECIALLY CRAFTED FILES: This vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted project files. This may require social engineering to get the operator to download the files and execute them. 6. LACK OF TELNET DAEMON AUTHENTICATION: SIMATIC panels include a telnet daemon by default; however, the daemon does not include any authentication functions. 7. STRING STACK OVERFLOW: The runtime loader listens on Ports 2308/TCP or 50523/TCP while transfer mode is activated but does not properly validate the length of data segments and Unicode strings, which may cause a stack overflow. This vulnerability may lead to remote code execution. 8. DIRECTORY TRAVERSAL: The runtime loader listens on Ports 2308/TCP or 50523/TCP while transfer mode is activated but does not properly validate incoming strings. This allows an attacker full access (read, write, and execute) to any file within the file system. 9. DENIALS OF SERVICE: The runtime loader listens on Ports 2308/TCP or 50523/TCP while transfer mode is activated but does not sufficiently validate incoming data. Multiple vulnerabilities allow a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, which leads to a program crash. 10.DIRECTORY TRAVERSAL: The HMI web server does not properly validate URLs within HTTP requests on Ports 80/TCP and 443/TCP. By manipulating URLs with encoded backslashes, directory traversal is possible. This allows an attacker read access for all files within the file system. 11.ARBITRARY MEMORY READ ACCESS: The HMI web server does not properly validate HTTP requests. By manipulating the first byte within a URL, the server switches to a special interpretation of the URL. This allows an attacker to read the application process memory and perform a DoS attack by specifying invalid memory locations. For additional information see ICSA-12-030-01.",
