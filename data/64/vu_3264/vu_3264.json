  "Impact": "Resource Starvation Anyone with access to an account on the system can run programs or write files as the default user. The danger of compromising the default user depends primarily on the other files in your system owned by that user. For example, on many systems the line printer spool directory (e.g., /var/spool/lpd) is owned by daemon. Because the line printer subsystem runs setuid root, it may be possible to gain additional privileges. However, some other systems have no files owned by user daemon on the default system, and the only files owned by group daemon are not writable by that group; hence, the danger is minimal. Buffer Overflows Anyone with access to an account on the system can gain root access.",
