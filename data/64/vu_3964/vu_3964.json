  "Description": "modload calls ld - but it doesn't call it using a\nfull pathname so that if you have a program called ld earlier\nin your path when you call loadmodule you can have your ld\nprogram run with the effective UID of 0 when modload has been\nexec'd by loadmodule (which is suid root).  101200-01 fixes this.\n\nLoadmodule calls modload with arguments that cause modload\nto exec some shell scripts.  Those scripts call at least one program\n(\"chmod\") without a full pathname so is vulnerable to a PATH attack.\n100448-02 fixes this by execle`ing modload with a new envirornment\nthat only includes a PATH and IFS.",
