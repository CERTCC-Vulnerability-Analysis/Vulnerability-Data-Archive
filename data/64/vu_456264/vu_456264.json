  "Description": "RTMPDump 2.4 TALOS-CAN-0066 -- CVE-2015-8270 RTMPDump librtmp AMF3 MemberName Denial of Service Vulnerability :: Description The vulnerability occurs within the AMF3ReadString function within amf.c. If an attacker sets up a malicious RTMP Media server that defines an AMF3 Class\n'memberName' string by reference, the 'memberName' property of that object is \nnot assigned, leading to an invalid pointer dereference when attempting to \ndisplay the invalid 'memberName' in a debug message. This also occurs if a \nliteral string value is defined but not in the datastream. TALOS-CAN-0067 -- CVE-2015-8271 RTMPDump librtmp AMF3 Class Member Count Remote Code Execution Vulnerability :: Description The vulnerability occurs within the AMF3CD_AddProp function within amf.c. If an attacker sets up a malicious RTMP Media server that defines the number\nof AMF3 Class Members in a certain way, the attacker can write data to a pointer\ncopied to an arbitrary address ending in 0. This leads to a \"write-what-where\"\ncondition that could lead to arbitrary remote code execution. TALOS-CAN-0068 -- CVE-2015-8272 RTMPDump rtmpsrv PlayPath Null Pointer Dereference :: Description A vulnerability exists in rtmpsrv in which an attacker can \nentice a user to utilize rtmpsrv to save an RTMP media stream\nthat is missing a playpath. This leads to a NULL pointer \ndereference, crashing the program.",
