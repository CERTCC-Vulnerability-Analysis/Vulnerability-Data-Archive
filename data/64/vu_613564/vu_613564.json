  "Workarounds": "Do not follow unsolicited links In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. Read and send email in plain text format An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted HTML email. Only reading email in plaintext will prevent exploitation of this vulnerability through email. Consider the security of fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when possible. If you use Microsoft Outlook, we encourage you to apply the Outlook Email Security Update. The update configures Outlook to open email messages in the Restricted Sites Zone, where Active scripting is disabled by default. In addition, the update provides further protection against malicious code that attempts to propagate via Outlook. The Outlook Email Security Update is available for Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000. The functionality of the Outlook Email Security Update is included in Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6. Outlook 2003 includes these and other security enhancements. Configure Windows Explorer to use Windows Classic Folders When Windows Explorer is configured to use the \"Show common tasks in folders\" option, HTML within a file may be processed when that file is selected. If the \"Show common tasks in folders\" is enabled, selecting a specially crafted HTML document in Windows Explorer may trigger this vulnerability. Note that the \"Show common tasks in folders\" is enabled by default. To mitigate this attack vector, enable the \"Use Windows classic folders\" option. To enable this option in Windows Explorer: Open Windows Explorer\nSelect Folder Options from the Tools menu\nSelect the \"Use Windows classic folders\" option in the Tasks section",
