  "Description": "Fortinet FortiGate and FortiWiFi 4.00.6 and possibly earlier versions are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks (CWE-300) and a heap-based overflow vulnerability (CWE-122). The vulnerabilities exist in the FortiManager service running on TCP port 541. CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint ('Man-in-the-Middle') - CVE-2014-0351\nThe FortiManager remote service relies on client-side SSL certificates to encrypt traffic between the client and server. It is possible for a client to specify the SSL cipher suite to use for the connection, including a cipher suite that does not use certificates for authentication, such as ADH-AES256-SHA. This could allow an adjacent unprivileged attacker to man-in-the-middle communications between the client and FortiManager service. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow - CVE-2014-2216\nThe FortiManager remote service uses a protocol with a message format that will allocate space for eight argument pointers on the heap. However, when parsing the message format an arbitrary number of argument pointers are accepted. This can cause a heap-based buffer overflow. A remote, unprivileged attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on the appliance. The CVSS score reflects CVE-2014-2216.",
