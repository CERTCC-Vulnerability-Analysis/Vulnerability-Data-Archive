Disable remote access\nDisabling remote access may help mitigate this vulnerability. Do not open untrusted links\nAn attacker may be able to create a specially crafted URL or HTML page that exploits this vulnerability. Do not open or follow untrusted hyperlinks sent through email or instant messages. Secure your wireless network\nRestricting access to your wireless network may also mitigate this vulnerability.
