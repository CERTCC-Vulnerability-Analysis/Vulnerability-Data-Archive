  "Impact": "As with a number of other web servers, nginx is designed to operate with a single privileged master process and multiple unprivileged worker processes handling specific requests. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the worker process or cause the worker process to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",

  "Description": "nginx is an HTTP server and mail proxy server that is available for a number of different platforms. A buffer underflow vulnerability exists in the ngx_http_parse_complex_uri() function when handling specially crafted URIs. Exploitation of this vulnerability would cause the nginx server to write data contained in the URI to heap memory before the allocated buffer.",
