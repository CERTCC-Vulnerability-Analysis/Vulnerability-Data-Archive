Right-click the web server, then choose Properties, then Master Properties, then WWW Service. 3. Choose Edit, then HomeDirectory, then Configuration\n\t4. Remove the .HTR entry\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, in addition to .HTR, Microsoft also recommends removing several other so-called script mappings. Apply the appropriate vendor patch: IIS 4.0:  http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=27492\nIIS 5.0:  http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=27491\nNote that these are the most recent patches as referenced in MS01-004.

  "Overview": "A vulnerability exists in Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) that could disclose sensitive information contained in CGI-type files. Typically a CGI/script file on a web server should only be executable and not readable to remote users. Sensitive information contained in CGI-type files file might include user credentials for access to a back-end database. This is a variation of the vulnerability previously discussed in VU#35085 and Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-031.",
