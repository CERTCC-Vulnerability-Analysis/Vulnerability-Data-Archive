  "Description": "DENIAL OF SERVICE VULNERABILITY 1: A vulnerability exists that may allow an attacker to cause a DoS and possibly execute arbitrary code if the attacker sends a specially crafted packet to zenAdminSrv.exe on Port 50777/TCP. The vendor has assigned Reference Number 25240 to the available update. DENIAL OF SERVICE VULNERABILITY 2: A second vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to crash the ZenSysSrv.exe service resulting in a DoS and possibly allow arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability can be exploited by connecting and disconnecting multiple times to the ZenSysSrv.exe service on Port 1101/TCP. The vendor has assigned Reference Number 25212 to the available update. For additional information see ICSA-12-013-01.",
