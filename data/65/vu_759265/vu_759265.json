  "Impact": "An attacker can cause a service to crash if they can redirect authentication requests to a malicious KDC under their control. While it is not clear if this vulnerability is exploitable to gain privileges, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a client making an authentication request to the malicious server. Since the client typically executes as root, root privileges may be gained.",
