  "Impact": "Based on information from the Washington Courts, there appears to be little or no consequence to the SQL injection vulnerability. The Washington Courts system has stated that there is no sensitive information on the site and that the site has read-only access to back-end databases. Assuming there are no exceptions, an attacker could only gain read access to publicly available information. An attacker could exploit the cross-site scripting vulnerability to manipulate the site's appearance to a victim who browsed to an attacker-supplied URL. An attacker may be able to entice a victim to provide sensitive information in the context of the Washington Courts website. It does not appear that the site features user authentication, and no authentication information appears in cookies.",
