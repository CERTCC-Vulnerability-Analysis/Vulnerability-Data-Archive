  "VendorStatement": "The Fedora Project distributes Sendmail packages in Fedora Core 4 and 5. By default on Fedora Core systems, Sendmail is configured to only accept connections locally. Only users who had configured Sendmail to listen to remote hosts and opened their firewall would have been potentially vulnerable to this issue. Additionally in Fedora Core 5, the Sendmail daemon has protection of a SELinux targeted policy by default. Updates are available for Fedora Core 4 and 5 to correct this flaw, please see http://fedora.redhat.com/Download/updates.html",
