  "Description": "ordist(1c) is a program used to maintain identical copies of files over\nmultiple hosts.  It preserves the owner, group, mode and mtime of a\nfile if possible.\n\nDue to insufficient bounds checking on arguments which are supplied\nby users, it is possible to overwrite the internal stack space of the\nordist program while it is executing.  By supplying a carefully designed\nargument to the ordist program, intruders may be able to force ordist to\nexecute arbitrary commands.  As ordist is setuid root, this may allow\nintruders to run arbitrary commands with the privileges of root.\n\nSilicon Graphics Inc. acknowledges the ordist buffer overrun vulnerability\npublically reported by several individuals and in AUSCERT Advisory AA-97.23.\n\nCurrently, Silicon Graphics Inc. is investigating and no further information\nis available for public release at this time.\n\nAs further information becomes available, additional advisories will be\nissued via the normal SGI security information distribution methods\nincluding the wiretap mailing list.",
