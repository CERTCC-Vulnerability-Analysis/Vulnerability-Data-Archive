  "Description": "a) Host A send a single forged UDP packet to host B:7 (host B, port 7\nwhich is the echo port) with a source address of host B:7.  This\ninduces that remote host B to get into a tight loop sending a packet\nin circles to its echo daemon.  The echo daemon responds with all data\nthat it receives, to the source address of the sender.  If the source\naddress and port are an echo daemon, the packet just keeps getting\necho'ed via the loopback interface.  This brings the machine load to\n1.\n\nb) Same attack, but instead of sending the packet to B:7 with a source\naddress of B:7, it is sent to B:7 with a source address of the broadcast\naddress of the network B is attached to i.e. x.y.z.255:7.  B gladly\nresponds to the sender which in this case is the broadcast address,\nand induces all other machines running the echo service ont the LAN to\nflood the network with packets destined for B.",
