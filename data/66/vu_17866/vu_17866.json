  "Description": "A vulnerability has been discovered in the IRIX 5.3, 6.1, and 6.2\noperating systems regarding the permissions tool under the IRIX\ndesktop environment.\n\nNormally, this tool is used by users to modify the permissions on their\nfiles and files they are privileged for.  Under certain conditions, a user\nmay be able to modify the permissions for restricted files.  This is SGI\nBug #375613.\n\nIn order to exploit this vulnerability, it is necessary to have access\nto a local account that can start the graphical permissions tool.\nRefer to SGI Security Advisory 19951002 and/or system documentation\nregarding password issues.\n\nSGI Engineering has investigated this issue and recommends the following\nsteps for neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these\nmeasures be done on ALL SGI systems running IRIX 5.3, 6.1, and 6.2.\nThis issue will be corrected in future releases of IRIX.",
