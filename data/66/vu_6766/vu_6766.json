  "Description": "With some implementations of the ftpd, if the client issues a\n\"quote pasv\" command, the server panics and dumps core.  This core\nfile is world readable.  Even better, if a user attempts to login\nbeforehand, the core file is likely to contain authtication\ninformation (such as the contents of a password file or shadow\nfile) regardless of whether the attempt to login was successful.\n\nIn order to do this, the ftp daemon must have a writeable area as\nthe home directory of the parent uid.",
