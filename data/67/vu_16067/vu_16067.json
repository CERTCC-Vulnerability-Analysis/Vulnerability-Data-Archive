  "Description": "The reporter writes:\n\nSuperProbe is a program supplied with XFree86 (to determine the\ntype of video hardware installed in the machine), and it is\ninstalled setuid root in many Linux distributions. It has already\nbeen discussed here that SuperProbe got some buffer overflows, but\nthere still seems to be no exploit. The reason for this might be\nthat the exploit has to be a bit unusual. That's why I decided to\npost the exploit, as an example of exploiting an overflow without\ndealing with the return address.",
