  "Description": "NeXTSTEP has shipped with the \"/\" directory\nworld-writeable. In NEXTSTEP 3.2, there is a major vulnerability in the\n\"/etc/rc\" file that can be exploited very easily to grant root\naccess to anyone who has an account on the computer.  This is a\nnew problem in 3.2; it wasn't in 3.1.\n\nOf course, the real problem is that 1 is 777.  This leads to many more exploits.",
