  "Overview": "A buffer overflow exists in the iPlanet Web Servers (Enterprise and FastTrack Editions) that may allow remote attackers to gain read access to sensitive information contained in the memory of the web server process. The information disclosed may include userids, passwords, cookies or authentication data belonging to other users of the web server. With this data the attacker may be able to falsely authenticate themselves to the web server as other users. In some cases, the attacker may be able to prevent the normal operation of the web server using this vulnerability.",
