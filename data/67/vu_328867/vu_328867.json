  "Workarounds": "Disable FTP Inspection In some products it may be possible to disable the FTP application layer inspection feature, however this will most likely prevent passive FTP sessions from reaching an FTP server located behind a firewall, and may prevent active FTP sessions that originate from clients who are behind a firewall. Restrict Access Do not allow anonymous access to FTP servers from untrusted networks like the Internet. Note that this will only limit the number of potential sources of attacks; it will not prevent attacks from networks that are allowed to access the FTP servers. Disable Active FTP Do not allow untrusted FTP servers to initiate connections to FTP clients. This will prevent clients from using active FTP for data channel connections. Secure FTP Servers Keep exposed FTP servers up-to-date with the latest patches and disable all unnecessary services.",

  "Overview": "Firewalls and other systems that inspect FTP application layer traffic may not adequately maintain the state of FTP commands and responses. As a result, an attacker could establish arbitrary TCP connections to FTP servers or clients located behind a vulnerable firewall.",
