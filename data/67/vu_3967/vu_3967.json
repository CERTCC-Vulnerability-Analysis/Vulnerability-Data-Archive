  "Description": "There is a flaw in versions of sendmail based on version 5. The flaw allows users to run programs or append to files remotely.\n\nThe flaw is due to a slight difference in the way that addresses are\nparsed during collection, and queue running.  At collection, a space\ncharacter is considered to be part of an address, whereas during a\nqueue run, it is considered to delimit addresses.\n\nIn Sendmail V5\n\nMail can be sent to arbitrary commands if messages are queued. When messages are queued a space \" \" is considered to be a delimiter.  \n\nIn Sendmail V8 \n\nA \",\" can be used as a delimiter in a similar attack, but this will fail because checking for mailing to programs is much more strict in 8.x than in 5.x.",
