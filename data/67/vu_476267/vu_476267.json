  "Impact": "An intruder may be able to use this vulnerability to send mail (Spam), post News, get or send files from or to an FTP server, or send data to an HTTP server. It may even be possible to exploit a vulnerability in one of these services through this problem, though we are not certain of that at this time. For example, an intruder may be able to exploit this problem as a means of attacking a vulnerable web server that would ordinarily be protected by a firewall. Additionally, it may be possible for an intruder to cause denial-of-service conditions within the network by sending unexpected data to network services. This unexpected data may crash or hang the services receiving the data.",
