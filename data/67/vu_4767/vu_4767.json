  "Description": "The bug is that TkWWW will execute arbitrary Tcl code\nembedded in hypertext links in WWW documents.  Because it is possible to\nexecute Unix shell commands from Tcl, this means that TkWWW can be made to\nexecute arbitrary Unix shell commands when the user selects a\nhypertext link containing an URL of a certain form.  This is quite\nsimilar to a widely known bug in the handling of telnet URLs in\ncertain versions NCSA Mosaic.\n\nUpdate from reporter: TkWWW will execute arbitrary commands embedded in\na hypertext link when the document containing the link is _loaded_;\nthe user does _not_ have to actually _select_ the link.",
