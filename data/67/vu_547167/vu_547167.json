  "Description": "The communication between the CollabNet ScrumWorks Basic Server and CollabNet ScrumWorks Desktop Client is transmitting credential information in plaintext. The CollabNet ScrumWorks Basic Server communicates with the CollabNet ScrumWorks Desktop Client using unencrypted java objects. These unencrypted java objects contain the username and password of the active user or (by calling specific functions) all users on the CollabNet ScrumWorks Basic Server. An additional vulnerability exists in CollabNet ScrumWorks where the ScrumWorks Basic Server stores unencrypted client username and passwords in its internal database.", 
  "CVSS_AccessComplexity": "", 
  "CVSS_SecurityRequirementsAR": "", 
  "Resolution": "CollabNet has stated to CERT that the client passwords are encrypted in CollabNet ScrumWorks Pro, and there are no plans for adding an encryption feature into CollabNet ScrumWorks Basic. CollabNet ScrumWorks Basic should not be used for sensitive data.",
