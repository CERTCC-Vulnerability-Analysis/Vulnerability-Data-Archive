In addition access to the vulnerable plug-in will be disabled for users with versions of 2001B prior to Beta v5.18 Build #3659 who login to the server.",

  "Workarounds": "Block ICQ/SMS requests at the firewall Blocking connections to login.icq.com and access to ports 4000/UDP, 5190/TCP and the TCP port that your client chooses to listen on may prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Note that the client may establish a new listening port each time it is run. Note also that this does not protect you from attacks within the perimeter of your firewall. Block untrusted messages ICQ permits the user to deny direct connections from anyone without authorization or accept direct connections from known peers only. We recommend denying direct connections from anyone without authorization. By accepting direct connections from known peers, you may still be vulnerable to attacks that originate from known peers if the peer is compromised.",
