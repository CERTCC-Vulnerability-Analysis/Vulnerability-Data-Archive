  "Description": "INTEGER OVERFLOW: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to Port 1217/TCP. STACK OVERFLOW: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an overly long URL to Port 8080/TCP. CONTENT-LENGTH NULL POINTER: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Content-Length header to Port 8080/TCP. INVALID HTTP REQUEST NULL POINTER: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request with an unknown HTTP method to Port 8080/TCP. FOLDERS CREATION: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a web request containing a nonexistent directory to Port 8080/TCP. Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the creation of arbitrary directories. For additional information see ICSA-12-006-01.",
