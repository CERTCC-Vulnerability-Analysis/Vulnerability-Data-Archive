  "Description": "The Windows Canonical Display Driver (cdd.dll) does not properly sanitize information copied from user mode to kernel mode. Windows 7 for x64-based systems, Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based systems, and Windows Server 2008 R2 for Itanium-based systems are affected. Please note that the Server Core installation of Windows Server 2008 R2 is not affected. From Microsoft Security Advisory 2028859: The Canonical Display Driver (cdd.dll) is used by desktop composition to blend GDI and DirectX drawing. CDD emulates the interface of a Windows XP display driver for interactions with the Win32k GDI graphics engine.",
