  "Description": "The IBM security bulletin for CVE-2013-2970 states: A command injection vulnerability has been discovered within the IBM QRadar SIEM software that allows an authenticated user to execute operating system commands as a limited access user on the QRadar device. This access could be used to gain remote shell access as that webservices user. Even though authenticated users of the QRadar SIEM do not necessarily have shell access, action should be taken to ensure this issue is patched as soon as possible. The attack can be conducted over the internet. Some degree of specialized knowledge and techniques are required to conduct this attack. Multiple authentication attempts are required for this attack. An exploit may have a limited impact on the confidentiality of information and the integrity of data and could reduce performance / cause interruptions to availability. Additional details may be found in the full IBM security bulletin.",
