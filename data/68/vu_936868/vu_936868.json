  "Impact": "An intruder who exploits this vulnerability can remotely execute arbitrary code. On UNIX systems, this code runs as the 'oracle' user. From there, it is likely that an intruder could leverage that access to gain additional control over the system. If running on Windows systems, the intruder's code will run in the Local System security context. In either case, the data contained in the database is at risk.",

To do this edit the listener.ora file, removing the entries for extproc, and also delete the extproc binary which can be found in $ORACLE_HOME/bin. It is important to understand your service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate.",
