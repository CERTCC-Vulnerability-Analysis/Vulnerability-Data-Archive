  "Description": "Major web browsers have a security setting that will display\nconfirmation dialog before submitting unencrypted form data\nto a site. This is believed to work via the javascript \"onSubmit\"\nevent handler.\nHowever javascript can also send information to a site via the\n\"onchange\" command. This means that as a user is entering data\nin a field on a form that data can be sent immediately after\nexiting that field to a foreign site, without the confirmation dialog.",
