  "Impact": "In Outlook 2002, arbitrary code can be executed with the privileges of the user running Outlook. Also, email, calendar, and contact information accessible via Outlook can be read, modified, and/or deleted. In previous versions of Outlook, a user's folder view may be manipulated. According to Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-038:  \"In an Outlook 2002 client, this [vulnerability] could enable an attacker to delete mail, change calendar information, or take virtually any other action, including running arbitrary code on the user's machine. In contrast, in Outlook 98 and 2000 the attacker could use the control to manipulate the user's folder view, but could not use it to read, change or delete data, or to run code on the user's machine.\"",
