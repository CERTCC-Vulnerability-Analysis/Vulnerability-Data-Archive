In cooperation with AREVA, the US Department of Homeland (DHS) Security Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) developed Snort based network intrusion detection signatures that are available for AREVA customer use only to detect attempts to exploit vulnerabilities within the WebFGServer. Due to unique system configuration dependencies, the signatures must be tuned to your specific environment. Please contact AREVA to obtain these signatures. DHS and AREVA cannot provide support for the signatures at this time. Restrict Access Limit network access to hosts that require connections to the portal. Do not allow access to the portal from untrusted networks such as the internet.",
