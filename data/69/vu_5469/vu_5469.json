  "Description": "The /usr/bin/passwd program replaces the local shadow password\ndatabase, i.e., /etc/shadow, by the new one as following.\n\nunlink(\"/etc/oshadow\")\nrename(\"/etc/shadow\", \"/etc/oshadow\")\nrename(\"/etc/stmp\", \"/etc/shadow\")\n\nThis provides a way to remove the /etc/shadow file to any local\nuser who is registered in the local password database by sending a\nSIGKILL signal between the two rename commands.  In this way, the\n(backup) oshadow file no longer exists, and the new copy hasn't\nbeen put in place.",
