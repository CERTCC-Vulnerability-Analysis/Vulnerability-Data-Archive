Restrict anonymous access Restrict anonymous SMB access. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 246261 for information about configuring anonymous access in Windows 2000. Note this will not prevent authenticated users from exploiting this vulnerability, and may have adverse affects in mixed-mode domains. Anonymous SMB access to SAM accounts is restricted in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 by default. Other workarounds are available in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-040.",
