  "Description": "The Dell KACE K2000 Deployment Appliance is an integrated systems provisioning product for large-scale operating systems deployment. The database configuration supplied with some versions of the K2000 appliance includes a read-only account with a known username and password intended for use by third-party reporting applications. Insufficient restrictions are applied to this account. As a result, a remote attacker may be able to read sensitive account information from an affected system. Note that systems are only vulnerable if remote access to the database has been enabled. By default, remote access to the included database server is not enabled, however, an attacker may be able to leverage a separate vulnerability (e.g., VU#135606) to enable this access.",
