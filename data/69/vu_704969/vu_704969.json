  "Resolution": "Use the Xauthority facility\nX windows includes support for a security mechanism involving shared secrets between the X client and the X server. This mechanism usually involves storing the shared secret in a file named \".Xauthority\" which needs to be accessible by both the client and server. In this configuration, the security of the X windows connection is equal to the file system security of the .Xauthority file. Xauthority secrets are, however, sent in plaintext, and may be sniffed by an attacker with access to the network.",
