  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Unregister the HTML Help InfoTech protocol Unregister the InfoTech Protocol. Although this does not remove the vulnerability, it may remove some attack vectors such as viewing a specially crafted HTML document. According to the Microsoft Security Bulletin, the following steps will unregister the HTML Help InfoTech protocol: Click Start, click Run, type \"regsvr32 /u %windir%\\system32\\itss.dll\" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK. Note On Windows 98 and Windows Millennium Edition, replace \"system32\" with \"system\" in this command. A dialog box appears and confirms that the unregistration process has succeeded. Click OK to close the dialog box. Impact of Workaround: All HTML Help functionality will be unavailable. This will affect the online Help in Windows or in any application that uses HTML Help functionality.",
