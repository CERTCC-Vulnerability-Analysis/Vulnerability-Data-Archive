  "Description": "Vulnerability Lab has reported a vulnerability in the way Mozilla Thunderbird handles HTML elements in email content. Mozilla Thunderbird blocks the creation of certain HTML elements, such as script, when displaying email messages. Traditionally, a script element is created through the use of a <script> HTML tag. HTML elements, including script, can also be created through the use of an <object> tag that specifies a Data URI scheme (RFC 2397). The Data URI can specify a text/html mime type and encode the script in base64. In such cases, Thunderbird will execute the script contained in the email message when it is forwarded or replied to and the outgoing message is in HTML format. Simply displaying the email message does not appear to cause the script to execute. See Mozilla Bug Bounty #5 - WireTap Remote Web Vulnerability for more details. Testing indicates that Thunderbird 17.0.{6,7,8} are vulnerable. Earlier versions may also be vulnerable.",
