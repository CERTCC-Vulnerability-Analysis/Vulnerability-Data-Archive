  "Resolution": "Repair Perl Program Programs written in Perl that contain format string vulnerabilities should be changed to not include user data in format strings. Taint Mode Perl provides a \"taint\" mode (-T) that may detect format strings that include user data. However, taint mode will not catch all format string vulnerabilities and, when it  does detect an error, the program will be terminated. Thus, taint mode may stop a vulnerability from allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code, but such a vulnerability can still be used to terminate the program.",
