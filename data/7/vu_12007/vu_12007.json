  "Description": "If fsck fails during system boot, a privileged shell is run\non the system console. This behavior can represent a security\nvulnerability if users, who would normally not have root access,\nhave physical access to the console at boot time.  An attacker\ncan force the failure to occur so this is not a rare threat.",
