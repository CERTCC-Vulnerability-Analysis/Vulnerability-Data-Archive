  "Description": "Web Site A uses \"Basic Authentication\" to require a username and\npassword from site visitors.  A visitor browsing Site A with\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer is shifted to Site B via a \"Page\nRedirect\" (e.g., selecting an off-site link or an advertising\nbanner).  A vulnerability in Internet Explorer allows Site B to\nobtain, undetected, the basic authentication username and password\nthat was only meant for Site A.\n\nBackground:\nSite A is getting paid by Site B for these hits.  So when a Site A\nvisitor clicks on the SIte B Advertising Banner Site A will usually,\nfirst, move the site visitor to a sub-directory where some\ntype of accounting is performed.  Then Site A will point the user\nto Site B.  But, because of a vulnerability in Internet Explorer,\nSite B can still access the authentication information (probably\nby tricking IE into thinking that the browser is still in the Site A\ndomain).  A workaround is not to use a simple link command,\nbut to first clear the authenication information with the Refresh\ntechnique.",
