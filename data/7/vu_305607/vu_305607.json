  "Description": "CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions - CVE-2016-5662 The `/opt/bin/cli` script has setuid permissions by default, allowing an authenticated KiteWorks users to escalate privileges of commands to root. In practice, the user would likely already have administrator or root privileges. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CVE-2016-5663 An unauthenticated remote user may be able to conduct reflected cross-site scripting attacks using the code, error, and error_description parameters of oauth_callback.php. CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') - CVE-2016-5664 An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to view limited sets of  files outside of the webroot directory by a crafted HTTP request. CWE-16: Configuration According to the reporter, Accellion KiteWorks is pre-configured with insecure defaults that may allow a remote user to create an SSH tunnel for a local user and bypass typical authentication channels. The KiteWorks appliance also is configured to allow local user access without further authentication to the Apache Solr and Memcache instances. The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2016-5664.",
