  "Description": "Intel Supercomputers has a System V/3.2 based Unix machine (they call\nit an SRM - System Resource Manager) as a front end to their iPSC line\nof computers.  As released from Intel, /etc is mode 777.  It also gets\nchanged to mode 777 during some software upgrades.\n\nTheir System V/3.2 does not support sticky bits on directories, so\nthere is absolutely no protection against any user changing any file\nwithin /etc.\n\nJohn R.
