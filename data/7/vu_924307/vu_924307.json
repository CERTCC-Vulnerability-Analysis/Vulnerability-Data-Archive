  "Description": "The D-Link DIR-685 Xtreme N storage router when configured with WPA/WPA2 and an AES cipher with a pre-shared key (PSK) will fail to an open unencrypted wireless connection during heavy network load, such as, the transfer of several gigabytes of data. The router's wireless connection will remain in an open unencrypted state until the device is rebooted.",
