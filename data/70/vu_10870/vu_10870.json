  "Description": "The primary problem is the use of a single\npassword (i.e. 'password') for new users on the system. An attacker could\nuse an NTAS server and client to generate a dictionary of encrypted\npassword transactions, against which she could compare password change\ntransactions (which could be stolen from the target network using a packet\ntrace).",
