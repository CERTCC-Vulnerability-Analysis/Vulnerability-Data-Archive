  "Description": "On many web sites there exists a file called test-cgi (usually in\nthe cgi-bin directory or somewhere similar). There is a problem\nwith many of these test-cgi files. If your test-cgi file contains\nthe following line (verbatim) then you are probably vulnerable.\n\necho QUERY_STRING = $QUERY_STRING\n\nAll of these lines should have the variables enclosed in loose\nquotes (\"). Without these quotes certain special characters\n(specifically '*') get expanded where they shouldn't. Thus\nsubmitting a query of '*' will return the contents of the\ncurrent directory (probably where all of the cgi files are...\ngee, there's jj and phf. Hmmm what are all those other cgi's\nthat I haven't seen... wonder what holes exist in those?).\nSending in a query of '/*' will list the root directory.\nAnd so on, and so on.\n\nThis is the same as doing `echo *` when you've blown away 'ls'\n(not that this ever happens to anyone <grin>).\n\nThe easiest way to list out the directories is via the query\nstring. However, it is possible to do the same thing through\nmany of the other variables (ie $REMOTE_HOST, $REMOTE_USER, etc.)\nin the right situations.\n\n\nFix:\n\nThe quick fix is to place loose quotes around all of the\nvariables in the test-cgi file (they should have been there\nfrom the beginning!).\n\necho QUERY_STRING = \"$QUERY_STRING\"\n\nThis incorrect file has been seen in at least several versions\nof NCSA, and Apache.",
