  "Description": "Noticed that my NT machine was listening on port 1526.\nI did not recognize this port number as a WKS, and it was not listed in NT's\nservices file, so I becamse suspicious.  For lack of a better way, I\ntelnetted to the port to try and find out what it was\n\nAs soon as I disconnected, my CPU usage jumped to 100%.  Upon looking at\nTaskman, I saw that a process named tnslsnr80.exe was the culprit.  I could\nnot kill the process, and after waiting for about 5 minutes for it to go\naway, I was forced to reboot my machine.\n\nWhen my machine came back up, I did a search for tnslsnr80.exe, and found it\nin the Oracle directory.  Apparently this program listens for connections on\nport 1526 (port 1521 may be vulnerable as well), and is not expecting a mere\nuser to telnet to it and feed it garbage.\n\nI contacted Oracle two weeks ago, first via their web comments page, and\nthen again via e-mail, and they never acknowledged or responded.  It is my\nbelief that you can bring an NT machine down to it's knees if it is running\nOracle.\n\n\n",
