  "Description": "Paul Makowski's report states: /epan/dissectors/packet-dect.c contains a stack-based buffer overflow via a call to memcpy() whose length is controlled by the attacker. Absent exploit mitigations independant of Wireshark's default build options, an attacker is able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running a packet capture. On *NIX systems, such capability is frequently reserved for the root user. The overflowable buffer is pkt_bfield.Data.",
