  "Description": "We have just discovered a serious problem with the standard\nconfiguration of a Solaris 2.5 NIS+ server.  The permissions on the\nNIS+ passwd table are such that any user with credentials can\nchange their UID to become root.  (Normally all users have\ncredentials, these are not something just given to administrators)\n\nProblems with NIS+ access rights after 2.5 install and 'nisserver\n-r' NIS+ setup\n\nSummary:\n\nAfter installing Solaris 2.5 and then running nisserver -r to\ninitialise the system as a NIS+ root server, the access rights on\nthe passwd map columns are very insecure.  They allow any user to\nchange all the fields in their NIS+ entry, which includes their\nUID.  I tested this and was able to change my UID to 0 with the\ncommand\n\nnistbladm -m uid=0 '[name=username],passwd'\n\nAs you can see nearly every column has r(ead), m(odify), c(reate)\nand d(estroy) permissions for owner and group (the first column is\nnobody, or an unauthenicated person).\n\nWhen a user is added to the NIS+ tables with nisaddent, the\nownership of the entry is automatically set to that user (although\nwe can't find this documented anywhere).  This means that the\n\"owner\" permissions shown above apply to the user for each entry in\nthe password file.",
