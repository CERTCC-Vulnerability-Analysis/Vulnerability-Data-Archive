  "Impact": "An attacker who is able to send solicited IKE responses could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the IKE service or cause a denial of service. The attacker must act as an IKE responder, so therefore must have control over the responder, the ability to spoof IKE response packets, or the ability to redirect the IKE initiator to a responder controlled by the attacker.",
