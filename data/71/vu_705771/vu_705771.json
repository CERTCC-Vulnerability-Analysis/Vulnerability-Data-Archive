  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Depending on the particular way gtop is built and implemented, it may also be possible for an attacker to read kernel memory. The ability to read kernel data is particularly dangerous because there is often sensitive data such as terminal activity, network traffic, and other types of privileged information residing in kernel memory space. Because of this, it may be possible for an attacker to leverage this vulnerability to gain root access to the local system, and possibly other systems interacting with the host running the gtop daemon.",
