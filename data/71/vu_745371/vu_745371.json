  "Workarounds": "Disallow access to the telnet service (typically port 23/tcp) using firewall or packet-filtering technology. Blocking access to the telnet service will limit your exposure to attacks from outside your network perimeter. However, blocking port 23/tcp at a network perimeter would still allow any users, remote or local, within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements prior to deciding what changes are appropriate.",

  "Overview": "The telnetd program is a server for the telnet remote virtual terminal protocol. There is a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in telnet daemons derived from BSD source code. This vulnerability can crash the server, or be leveraged to gain root access.",
