  "Impact": "An attacker may be able to gain unintended access to files or other data if user-supplied input is used in certain manners after being sanitized by addslashes(). For example, if this sanitized data is processed in code which truncates file names after a NULL byte, the attacker can craft a file name which bypasses other checks or countermeasures. This behavior is seen in the PHP standard library functions include() and require() (and possibly others).",
