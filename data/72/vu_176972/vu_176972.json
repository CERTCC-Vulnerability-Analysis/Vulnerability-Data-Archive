  "Workarounds": "Until an update is available, you can avoid this problem through several techniques. First, you can use the anti-relay facilities provided by Domino. By putting a \"*\" in the \"Deny messages from external Internet domains to be sent to the following Internet domains\" field you can prevent mail originating externally from being delivered to a third-party site. Second, a third-party mail server (such as sendmail) may be able to filter out certain types of messages. For sendmail 8.10 and later, it has been reported that editing /etc/mail/sendmail.cf file and  changing the line that reads \"Kdequote dequote\" to \"Kdequote dequote -S\" stops attempts to exploit this weakness.",
