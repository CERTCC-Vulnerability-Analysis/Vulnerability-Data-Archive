  "Description": "CWE-611 - Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE') - CVE-2016-2340 Granite Data Services provides event driven, cross-framework application that can be found on Github (https://github.com/graniteds/graniteds). Granite Data Services (http://www.graniteds.org/) provides server and client libraries that can be used to connect desktop and mobile applications to a server using the Action Message Format (AMF3) or Java Media Framework (JMF) serialization protocols. Granite Data Services version 3.1.1-SNAPSHOT AMF framework is vulnerable to a XML external entity (XXE) attack. A XXE attacks how an application parses XML input. If the XML parsing is handled incorrectly it could potentially expose sensitive data on the server, denial of service, or server side request forgery.",
