  "Description": "ReadyDesk is a help desk ticketing web application designed to facilitate business internal or business to customer interactions. CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CVE-2016-5048 The user name field of http://<IP>/readydesk/chat/staff/default.aspx fails to properly escape single quote characters, or ', provided as field input. Through error-based, blind SQL injection attacks, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may obtain full database contents, including user passwords which are stored as SHA1 hashes. CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory - CVE-2016-5049 The SESID parameter of requests to http://<IP>/readydesk/chat/openattach.aspx is vulnerable to directory traversal and may be exploited to read arbitrary files on affected systems when combined with the FNAME parameter. For instance, to download SQL_Config.aspx, an attacker would make a request to: http://<IP>/readydesk/chat/openattach.aspx?SESID=..\\..\\hd\\data&FNAME=SQL_Config.aspx CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key - CVE-2016-5683 SQL Server user credentials stored in SQL_Config.aspx are encrypted using a hard-coded cryptographic key found in ReadyDesk.dll. An attacker capable of obtaining the encrypted password can easily decrypt it for use in further attacks. CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type - CVE-2016-5050 Files uploaded via http://<IP>/readydesk/chat/sendfile.aspx are not properly validated, allowing for arbitrary upload of files with a dangerous type. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code by uploading and making a request to a specially crafted aspx page. The CVE score below describes CVE-2016-5050.",
