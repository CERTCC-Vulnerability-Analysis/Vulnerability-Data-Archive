See Symantec AntiVirus Decomposition Buffer Overflow (SYM05-027) and Symantec AntiVirus library .rar decompression heap overflow vulnerability: Recommendations to customers for details. Depending on how the filtering mechcanism and the Symantec product identify RAR archives, it may be insufficient to rely on the file extention (.rar). Also, disabling RAR or other archive file scanning will prevent Symantec products from detecting viruses or other malicious code in those files.",
