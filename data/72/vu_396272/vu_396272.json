  "Overview": "mgetty, a replacement for getty designed to support modem and fax use, creates files of a predictable name in a world-writable directory without checking for the prior existence or ownership of the file. Using a symbolic link attack, an intruder might cause the overwrite of arbitrary files on the system, but the risk of elevated privileges is low.",
