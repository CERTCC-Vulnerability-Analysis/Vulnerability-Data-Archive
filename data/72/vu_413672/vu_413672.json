  "Description": "According to 7T's website: \"IGSS is a state-of-the art SCADA system used for monitoring and controlling industrial processes. With more than 25 years in business and a very loyal customer base, IGSS is a proven system in many industries worldwide. IGSS communicates with all major industry standard PLCs.\" 7T IGSS version 8 and 9 is vulnerable to a remote heap corruption vulnerability caused by a remote attacker sending a specially crafted packet to the server\u2019s listening port (20222/TCP). The attacker can crash the server or possibly execute arbitrary code. For additional information see ICS-CERT Advisory ICSA-11-018-02.",
