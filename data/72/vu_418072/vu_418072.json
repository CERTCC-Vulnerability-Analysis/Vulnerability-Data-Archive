  "Description": "CWE-636: Not Failing Securely ('Failing Open') Comcast XFINITY Home Security system components use the ZigBee communication protocol over a 2.4 GHz radio frequency band to maintain state between sensors and the base station. When component communications are disrupted, the system does not trigger any alerts and additionally may take from minutes to hours to re-establish communications, during which time no alarm escalation occurs. An attacker capable of disrupting wireless communications can avoid triggering Home Security alarm events. For more details, refer to Rapid7's disclosure.",
