  "Workarounds": "two possible fixes: 1) If client software will automatically try a <1024 source port if it is\nsetuid, then just change sqlexecd to require a source port <1024. (As is\npretty much mandated by saying that you're doing BSD security) 2. Alternatively, sqlexecd could attempt to verify the remote user using\nident. Since you've already stated that root on the remote host is\ntrusted, this isn't a security problem. A temporary fix to decrease the vulnerability by restricting it to\nparticular users that can be broken into, is to convert to using\nindividual .rhosts files instead of a hosts.equiv file.",
