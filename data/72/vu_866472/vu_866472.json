  "Overview": "The krb5_rd_cred() function in the MIT Kerberos 5 library does not securely deallocate heap memory when decoding ASN.1 structures, resulting in a double-free vulnerability. A remote, authenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on any system running an application that calls krb5_rd_cred(). This includes Kerberos application servers and other applications that process Kerberos authentication via the MIT Kerberos 5 library, GSSAPI, and other libraries.",
