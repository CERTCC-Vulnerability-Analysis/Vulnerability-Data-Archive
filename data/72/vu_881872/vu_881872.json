  "Workarounds": "Disable telnet Disable telnet if it's not needed. Telnet can be disabled by issuing the following command: # svcadm disable telnet\nRestrict access You may wish to block access to the vulnerable software from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to the ports used by Sun Solaris telnet (typically 23/tcp). This will limit your exposure to attacks. Prefer SSH over telnet SSH provides a comparatively more secure method for remotely logging into a system than telnet. As general advice, we recommend using SSH rather than telnet.",
