  "Description": "There is a vulnerability with the SITE EXEC command feature of the\nFTP daemon (ftpd) found in versions of ftpd that support the SITE EXEC\nfeature.  This vulnerability allows local or remote users to gain root\naccess.\n\nThe second vulnerability involves a race condition found in some ftpd\nimplementations.  This vulnerability allows local users to gain root\naccess.\n\nNote also -\n\nSome copies of the source code for versions 2.2 and 2.1f of the\nwuarchive ftpd were modified by an intruder, and contain a Trojan\nhorse.  If your FTP daemon was compiled from the intruder-modified\nsource code, you are vulnerable.\n\nIt is possible that previous versions of the source code for the server\nwere modified in a similar manner.\n\nIf you are running the wuarchive ftpd, but not providing anonymous FTP\naccess, you are still vulnerable to this Trojan horse.",

  "Workarounds": "1. remove \"site exec\" from commands. 2. stop anonymous uploading via adding \"chmod no anonymous\" and\n\"umask no anonymous\" to ftpaccess file. 3. remove ftp-exec subdirectory in ~ftp/bin\n4. Obtain and install wu-ftpd 2.3 Making sure that the version of wu-ftpd that your machine is running\nis 2.3 and that it checksums properly with the version on UUNET is\nthe best way to insure that your site is not vulnerable by the\ntrojan horse. It is possible that previous versions of the server may have been\nmodified in the same manner. We are still investigating this\npossibility. You are *strongly* encouraged to grab the new\nversion and compile it. You may want to turn off ftp access to\nyour machine while you fetch and compile the new version.",
