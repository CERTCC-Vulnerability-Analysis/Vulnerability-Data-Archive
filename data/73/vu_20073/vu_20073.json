  "Description": "The suid root fsdump tool (tested on IRIX 5.3 and 6.2) creates output files in a tmp directory called fsdump.dir and fsdump.pag. The ownership of the files is changed to the uid which executes the fsdump process regardless of wether or not these files already exist. It is possible for an intruder to create a symbolic link before running fsdump for the fsdump.dir and fsdump.pag files in order to change the ownership of any privliged file to the uid of the intruder.",
