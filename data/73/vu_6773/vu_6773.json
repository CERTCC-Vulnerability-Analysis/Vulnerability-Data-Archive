  "Description": "This is only one of a class of problems with rdist.  Rdist has a\nfairly complex set of facilities for constructing commands.  These use\nmacros and syntax such as ~.  Except for one routine, this code in\ngeneral does not do bounds-checking.  It is possible to make an array overflow into the variable \"userid\" and set that variable to 0. This causes the \"special\" commands to be run as root rather than as the user's actual id.  \n\nThis is, of course, a classic C string-handling problem.\n \nIt would be easy to fix this one specific problem.  However \na more general fix is called for to make sure that all array bounds\nare handled correctly.",
