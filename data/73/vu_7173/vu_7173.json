  "Description": "On UNIX OS's the HP Jetadmin software, which is used to control HP-Laserjet printers, comes with some scripts to build up a pcl banner page. These scripts are called when lpr uses the \"-J\" flag. The scripts do not check for metacharacters; thus, it is possible to pass in arbitrary commands using backticks or semicolons via the command line which will execute with the privliges of which the printing software is executing - root by default.
