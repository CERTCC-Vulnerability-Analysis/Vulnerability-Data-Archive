  "Workarounds": "Disable Vulnerable Service If it is not needed, disable Kerberos 4 support. In MIT Kerberos 5, disable kadmin4. In KTH Heimdal, compile kadmind without Kerberos 4 support. This will prevent Kerberos 4 administrative clients from accessing the Kerberos database. Block or Restrict Access Block access to the Kerberos administration server from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Furthermore, only allow access to the server from trusted administrative hosts. The assigned port for the Kerberos 4 administrative protocol is 751/tcp and 751/udp; however, this may be configured differently. It may also be necessary to block access to Kerberos 5 administration daemons that support the Kerberos 4 administration protocol. The assigned port for the Kerberos 5 administrative protocol is 749/tcp and 749/udp. Again, this may be configured differently. Note that this workaround will not prevent exploitation, but it will limit the possible sources of attacks.",
