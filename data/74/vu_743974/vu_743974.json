  "Workarounds": "Disable Active scripting\nDisabling Active scripting prevents execCommand from running. As a result, the SaveAs command will not execute, thus preventing the spoofed save dialog. Instructions for disabling Active scripting can be found in the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Note that disabling Active scripting will reduce the functionality of many web sites. Disable \"Hide extensions for known file types\" The default configuration for Windows is to hide the extensions for known file types. An attacker can take advantage of this by creating a file with double extensions. For example, \"file.html.exe\" will appear as \"file.html\" by default. This can allow executable files to masquerade as less dangerous file types. Configure Windows Explorer to show all file extensions. Displaying the actual file extension will make it easier to understand what type of file is being saved.",
