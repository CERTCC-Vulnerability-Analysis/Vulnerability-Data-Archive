  "Description": "info:HR is \"...a robust, general-purpose Human Resources Information System (HRIS)\" that runs on the Microsoft Windows platform and uses Microsoft SQL Server. info:HR stores database credentials in a registry key that allows read access to any local user. The database password is weakly obfuscated with a static key and can be easily deciphered. Aspects of this vulnerability include CWE-314: Cleartext Storage in the Registry, CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.",
