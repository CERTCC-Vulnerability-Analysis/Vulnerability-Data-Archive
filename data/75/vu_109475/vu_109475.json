  "Resolution": "On affected Windows NT or 2000 systems, locate the following key in the registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DNS\\Parameters On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value: Value Name: SecureResponses\n     Data Type: REG_DWORD\n     Value: 1 On Windows 2000 Server systems, there is a GUI option \"Secure cache against pollution\" in the DNS Management Console which can set the registry key value automatically. Please see the Knowledge Base article Q241352 for step-by-step instructions. (Note that even given the stronger configuration, other forms of attack involving DNS cache poisoning are possible. This class of problem likely cannot be completely resolved until there is widely-deployed cryptographicly-secure authentication available for DNS. See the IETF dnsext Working Group for more information on this topic.)",
