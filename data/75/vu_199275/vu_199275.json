  "Impact": "The complete impact of this vulnerability is not yet known. Impact\nThe overall impact of this issue is limited due to: \u2022 Exploitation requires authenticated system access with sufficient privileges to access the Linux shell. \u2022 The seemem program file permissions only allow execution by the root user. Thus a successful exploit requires pre-\u00ad\u2010existing root access to the module. \u2022 Seemem is not used as part of normal operation of an X-\u00ad\u2010series chassis.",
