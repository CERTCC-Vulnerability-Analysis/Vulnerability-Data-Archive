This vulnerability was discovered by Vagner Sacramento during the development of his master thesis in the DIMAp/UFRN (Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics / Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte) under the orientation of Prof. Thais Vasconcelos Batista and Prof. Guido Lemos de Souza Filho. CAIS/RNP (the Brazilian Research Network CSIRT) publicly reported the vulnerability after conducting several experiments in order to validate its claims.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable recursion on any nameserver responding to DNS requests made by untrusted systems. As mentioned in \"Securing an Internet Name Server\": Disabling recursion puts your name servers into a passive mode, telling them never to send queries on behalf of other name servers or resolvers. A totally non-recursive name server is protected from cache poisoning, since it will only answer queries directed to it. It doesn't send queries, and hence doesn't cache any data. Disabling recursion can also prevent attackers from bouncing denial of services attacks off your name server by querying for external zones. Non-recursive nameservers should be much more resistant to exploitation of the server vulnerabilities listed above.",
