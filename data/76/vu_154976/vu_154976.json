  "Impact": "The complete impact of this vulnerability is not yet known. In the worst case, it could allow an intruder to execute code with root privileges, but that impact is unconfirmed. Because the overflow occurs in a buffer used to hold argv[0], an intruder cannot use this flaw to crash an existing snmpd.",
