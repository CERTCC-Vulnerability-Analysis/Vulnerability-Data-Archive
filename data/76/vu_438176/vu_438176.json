  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to send a specially crafted packet to an affected Cisco device may be able to cause that device to reboot. Sustained exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a denial-of-service. Because devices running IOS may transit traffic for a number of other networks, the secondary impacts of a denial of service may be severe.",

For instructions on how to turn off SIP processing, refer to the Workarounds section of  Cisco Security Advisory cisco-sa-20070131-sip. Restrict Access Cisco does not have any examples of a properly configured SIP router being affected by this vulnerability. If you do not need SIP processed on your router, you can also restrict public access to SIP (udp 5060 and TCP 5060) on your router from the edge of your network. Other workarounds and mitigation strategies can be found in the Cisco Applied Intelligence Response: Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the SIP Packet Reloads IOS Devices Not Configured for SIP Vulnerability document.",
