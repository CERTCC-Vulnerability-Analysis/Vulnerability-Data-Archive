  "Description": "Openfire 3.9.1, and possibly earlier versions, contains an uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) vulnerability when using XMPP DEFLATE message compression. It has been reported that a highly compressed XMPP message of 4MB that uncompresses to 4GB may cause a resource exhaustion denial of service. The highly compressed XMPP messages may be sent in parallel to enhance the denial of service.",
