  "Description": "EMC AutoStart is an enterprise software application developed to help networks and service maintain a high level of availability. AutoStart can manage clusters of applications or nodes as well as single instances. Affected versions of EMC AutoStart fail to communicate securely between nodes, leading to the possibility of packet injection. Remote code execution with SYSTEM or root privileges is possible for attackers with knowledge of the AutoStart domain name. By sending crafted packets to the ftagent running on the remote system, it is possible to run commands to write and execute data to an absolute or relative file path on the remote system.",
