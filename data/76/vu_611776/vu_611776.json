  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote intruder could modify DAD and cache settings. By modifying, creating, or deleting DADs, an intruder could gain access to PL/SQL applications or deny service legitimate users. Also, access to the PL/SQL gateway administration web interface exposes two buffer overflow vulnerabilities:  one in the DAD password field [VU#659043] and a second in the cache directory name [VU#923395].",

To protect the administration web pages, configure the PL/SQL gateway to require authentication as noted above under Restrict Access.
