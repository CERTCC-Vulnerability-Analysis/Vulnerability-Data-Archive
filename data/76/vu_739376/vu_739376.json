  "Impact": "When a victim views a malicious web page, an attacker could create a local file with a predictable name in the user's temporary files folder. If the attacker chooses to embed script commands in this file, these commands will be executed in the \"My Computer\" zone when the file is opened in Internet Explorer. This will allow the remote intruder to execute arbitrary commands as the user viewing the web page.",
