  "Workarounds": "IBM provides the following workarounds in Technote 1229918: To work around these issues in previous releases of Notes, the affected file viewers can be disabled. The buffer overflow vulnerabilities affect the following files: kvarce.dll, uudrdr.dll, tarrdr.dll and htmsr.dll. The directory traversal vulnerability affects the kvarce.dll file. There are three options for disabling these viewers: 1. Action: Delete the keyview.ini file in the Notes program directory. Results: When a user clicks View (for any file), a dialog box will be displayed with the message \"Unable to locate the viewer configuration file.\" 2. Action: Delete the problem files (ziprdr.dll, uudrdr.dll, htmsr.dll, tarrdr.dll). Result: When a user tries to view the specific file types (html pages, zip/tar/uud archives), a dialog box will be displayed with the message \"The viewer display window could not be initialized.\" All other file types work without returning the error message. 3. Action: Comment out specific lines in keyview.ini (by preceding the line with an asterisk * ) for any references to the problem files (dlls). For example: [KVARCVE] * 132=ziprdr.dll\n* 194=tarrdr.dll\n* 167=uudrdr.dll [KVDOCVE] 2=afsr.dll\n-1=hexsr.dll\n117=mifsr.dll\n13=dcasr.dll\n32=dw4sr.dll\n23=exesr.dll\n153=afsr.dll\n207=mimesr.dll\n208=mimesr.dll\n*210=htmsr.dll\n*251=htmsr.dll Result: When a user tries to view the specific file types (html files, tar/uud archives), a dialog box will be displayed with the message \"The viewer display window could not be initialized.\"",
