  "Impact": "An intruder with access to the CVS repository can read files on the system. If the user is normally allowed to update files in CVS, the intruder can also replace files on the system if file permissions allow. If the pserver daemon is running as root, files are accessed as the userid used in the pserver login. If the pserver daemon is running as a non-root user, then all files accesses are based on the uid of the pserver daemon.",
