  "Workarounds": "As a general practice, and to mitigate against this vulnerability if you are unable to install a patch, use NTFS file permissions to restrict IIS so that it can only access files contained in the web server. Additionally, because relative references to files cannot cross volume boundaries, you may wish to configure IIS such that the web folder is on a separate volume. That is, keep the web data on the D: drive and everything else on the C: drive. However, note that this provides only very limited protection and can be circumvented by an intruder.",

  "Overview": "A vulnerability exists in Microsoft IIS 4 and 5 such that an attacker visiting an IIS web site can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the IUSR_machinename account. This vulnerability is referred to as the \"Web Server Folder Directory Traversal\" vulnerability. This vulnerability has characteristics similar to vulnerabilities that have been widely exploited in the past. Unless remedial action is taken, we believe it is likely that systems with this vulnerability will be compromised.",
