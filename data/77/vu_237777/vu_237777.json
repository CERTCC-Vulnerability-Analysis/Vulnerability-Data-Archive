  "Impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a denial-of-service condition since a malicious program or applet may list other, legitimate programs or applets to the \"banned\" list in the Standard Security Manager. A malicious Java program that was designed to exploit this vulnerability could be hosted on an attacker's web page or introduced via HTML email. Any applications that depended on the now-banned Java modules from operating properly would be adversely affected. These conditions would persist for the lifetime of that instance of the VM-enabled application. Subsequent instances, or other instances held in parallel, would not be affected.",
