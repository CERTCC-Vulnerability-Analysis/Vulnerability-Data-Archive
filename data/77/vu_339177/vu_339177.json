  "Description": "Cisco AnyConnect is an SSL VPN solution that is commonly initiated through use of a web browser. When Internet Explorer is used, the AnyConnect VPN server provides an ActiveX control that downloads and installs the AnyConnect client software. One of the components provided by Cisco AnyConnect for use with Internet Explorer is an ActiveX control called the \"CISCO Portforwarder Control.\" This ActiveX control is provided by the file ciscopf.ocx. The Cisco Portforwarder ActiveX control contains a buffer overflow in its initialization parameters. We have confirmed that version 1.0.1.8 of the Portforwarder control is vulnerable. Previous versions may also be affected.",
