  "Impact": "These vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, gain access to sensitive information, or cause an DNS implementation to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner. Exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to take control of a DNS server. Once a DNS server compromised, the attacker may be able to launch attacks on other, unaffected DNS servers.",
