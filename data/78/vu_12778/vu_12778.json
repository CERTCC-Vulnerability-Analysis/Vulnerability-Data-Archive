  "Description": "The runpriv command allows a non-root user to attain privileges\n(but I don't fully understand this yet) to do work.  To attain\nthese priveleges, the user must authenticate themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, you can tell runpriv to use an arbitrary library to\ncarry out the authentication.  If you build your own library that\nwill authenticate you no matter what, you can attain arbitrary\nprivileges, and then use this to become a root user.",
