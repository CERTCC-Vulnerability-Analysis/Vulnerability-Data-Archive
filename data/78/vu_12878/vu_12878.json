  "Description": "The problem is actually that exec is honoring a setgid bit where the\ngroup permissions do not include the execute bit.  In Unixware, this means\nthat mandatory file locking is enabled for the file, and not that\nexec should set the effective gid to the group owner.  Apparently\nsomeone mucking in exec for 2.0 missed this fact.  It is rather\nobscure.",
