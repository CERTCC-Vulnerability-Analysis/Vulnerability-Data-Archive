  "Description": "CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\nAT&T Connect Participant Application for Windows v9.5.35 and possibly earlier versions contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. AT&T Connect allows a user to join a web conference via a web browser. When joining a conference, AT&T provides the .SVT file for the user to open. Upon opening the file, the user is able to join the conference. An attacker can send a malformed .SVT file to a victim which can allow the attacker to run arbitrary code in the context of the logged in user.",
