  "Impact": "Sensitive information, including cryptographic key material, may be leaked to other local users on the affected system. The paper describing this issue and its corresponding proof-of-concept exploit make assumptions about the relative quiescence of the target system. At this stage it is unclear how viable the analysis techniques outlined in the above paper would be on busy systems. Single user workstations and systems where users do not have the ability to run their own programs are unlikely to be affected by this specific issue.",
