  "Description": "Derek Soeder's vulnerability report states the following: Intuit Help System Protocol File Retrieval\nThe vulnerability described in this document can be exploited by malicious HTML and Javascript to retrieve a file from a ZIP archive to which the user viewing the HTML has local or network file system access. The attacker must know or guess the path and file name of the target ZIP archive and the target file it contains. A further significant limitation is that files in subdirectories inside of ZIP archives have proven inaccessible, based on a sampling of Windows ZIPs, Microsoft Office 2007 documents, JARs, and APKs. Intuit Help System Protocol URL Heap Corruption and Memory Leak\nThe vulnerability described in this document can potentially be exploited by malicious HTML and/or Javascript to execute arbitrary code as the user viewing the malicious content. Additional details may be found in the full advisories linked above.",
