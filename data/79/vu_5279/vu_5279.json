  "Description": "On many linux systems(Redhat imparticularly) updatedb is run nightly\naround 1:00. When it sorts the files that find gets, it creats a few files\nin /tmp called sort0<pid>000{1,2,etc}. Each is around 512k. The\nfirst file is created and filled, then if necassary, another is created\nand so on until it has your whole filesystem into a nice database. Well,\nonce the first file is created you can easily guess what the next filename\nwill be called as only the last character will change. If you create a\nlink to say, the shadow password file, updatedb will kindly overwrite it\nfor you",
