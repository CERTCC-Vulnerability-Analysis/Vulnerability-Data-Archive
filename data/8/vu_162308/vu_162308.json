  "Description": "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\nResin Pro 4.0.39 and possibly earlier versions perform incorrect Unicode transformations on output to HTTP responses for ISO-8859-1. This allows an attacker to bypass\u00a0filtering/encoding/validation done prior to the output transformation. An attacker can use specially crafted input characters on pages that by default respond with ISO-8859-1 (or can be forced to use it) to bypass\u00a0filtering/encoding/validation done prior to the output transformation. It should be noted that Resin's default encoding (charset) is ISO-8859-1.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. Restrict content to always use UTF-8 (or other safe charsets) Using HttpServletResponse.setContentType() to set the response charset to UTF-8. For example: response.setContentType(\"text/html;charset=UTF-8\"); According to Caucho's base documentation, it is possible to change the system wide encoding to\u00a0use UTF-8 with a single directive.",
