  "Description": "According to ICSA-11-082-01: IntegraXor is vulnerable to the execution of an unauthenticated SQL statement. An attacker may execute arbitrary SQL statements against the IntegraXor database by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request. Exploitation of this vulnerability results in potential data leakage, data manipulation, and remote code execution against the backend host running the database service.",

  "Resolution": "According to ICSA-11-082-01: Use the following link to obtain the patched version of Ecava IntegraXor (Build 4050): http://www.integraxor.com/download/rc.msi\nFor more information, customers should contact Ecava support at support@integraxor.com. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices; critical devices should not directly face the Internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network. If remote access is required, employ secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).",
