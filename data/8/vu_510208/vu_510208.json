  "Description": "According to ISC: When named is running as an authoritative server for a zone and receives a query for that zone data, it first checks for allow-query acls in the zone statement, then in that view, then in global options. If none of these exist, it defaults to allowing any query (allow-query {\"any\"};). With this bug, if the allow-query is not set in the zone statement, it failed to check in view or global options and fell back to the default of allowing any query. This means that queries that the zone owner did not wish to allow were incorrectly allowed. This bug doesn't affect allow-recursion or allow-query-cache acls, since they are not relevant to a zone for which the server is authoritative.",
