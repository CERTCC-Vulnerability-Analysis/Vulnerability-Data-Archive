  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the SQL Server service account. This access could be leveraged by the attacker to take any action on the system. It can be exploited using SQL Injection most probably against MS Access databases or SQL Server, also Web applcations that allow users to submit arbitrary SQL queries values are vulnerable. On SQL Server if Microsoft Jet OLE DB provider has been enabled or there is a Linkded Server to a Microsoft Jet supported database any SQL Server user will be able to exploit this vulnerability. Tries and explotation of this vulnerability in web applications using Active Server Pages (ASP) with Microsoft Jet Engine, could cause IIS 5.0 (not tested in other IIS versions but they may have the same\nbehaviour) to stop processing Active Server Pages (ASP).",
