  "Description": "These outages appear to be the result of a bug in the current version\nof Cisco's operating system.\n\nIn both cases, our respective Cisco router system logs reported\n'process table full' immediately prior to the labeling of an interface\nas 'line protocol down' (and thereby shutting down that interface).  As\nNorthWestNet, Cisco, and MCI continued to compare notes, it was\nspeculated that there was a bug in the IOS that Cisco was running that\nwould allow a certain stream of data to effectively shut down a router\ninterface.",
