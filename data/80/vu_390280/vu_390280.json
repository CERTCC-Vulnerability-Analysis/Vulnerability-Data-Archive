  "Impact": "An attacker with the ability to modify Kerberos Telnet negotiation commands sent from server to client may be able to cause the connection to negotiate less secure authentication and encryption options, including no encryption. The attacker may then be able to read data that the user presumes to be securely encrypted.",

  "Resolution": "Enforce Client Encryption Preference\nOne defense against the attacks described in Josefsson's paper is to strictly enforce the client's preferences and abort the connection if authentication or encryption cannot be negotiated. The following is an excerpt from a man page entry for a BSD-derived telnet command option to enable data encryption: -x  Turn on encryption of the data stream. When this option is turned on,  tel-\n        net  will  exit  with  an error if authentication cannot be negotiated or if\n        encryption cannot be turned on. Josefsson references a patch for the KTH Kerberos V (Heimdal) implementation that enforces the client's encryption preference.",

  "Overview": "A vulnerability exists in the KTH Kerberos IV and Kerberos V (Heimdal) Telnet implementations. When a KTH Kerberos Telnet client requests data encryption and the server does not appear to support it, the client will establish the connection using no encryption. A properly located attacker can then capture and read the contents of the Telnet session.",
