  "Overview": "Shadow-utils is an encryption and account management package freely distributed for many Linux implementations. The useradd program in this package creates insecure temporary files with predictable names in a write-protected directory. If this directory is changed to be writable, an attacker may be able to use a symbolic link attack to overwrite arbitrary files.",
