  "Description": "HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW A heap-based overflow can be used to overwrite function pointers that exist in memory with pointers to the attacker\u2019s code. Applications that do not explicitly use function pointers are still vulnerable, as unrelated run-time programs can leave operational function pointers in memory. The heap-based buffer overflow in WWCabFile ActiveX Component can be exploited by sending a long string of data to the \u201cOpen\u201d member of the WWCabFile component. HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW According to Invensys, a CVSS V2 base score of 6.0 has also been assigned. The heap-based buffer overflow can be exploited by sending a long data string to the \u201cAddFile\u201d member of the WWCabFile component.",
