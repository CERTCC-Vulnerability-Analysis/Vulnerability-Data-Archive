  "Description": "CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\nCaucho Resin version 4.0.37 and possibly earlier versions contains a CRLF injection vulnerability. When constructing the Set-Cookie header of an HTTP response, Caucho Resin does not neutralize CRLF sequences within the cookie value. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML content (including script) to display arbitrary data to the user by adding Carriage Return Linefeed (CRLF) symbols into the cookie value or index.",
