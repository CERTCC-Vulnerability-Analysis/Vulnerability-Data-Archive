  "Description": "The ISC security advisory states: \"When an authoritative server processes a successful IXFR transfer or a dynamic update, there is a small window of time during which the IXFR/update coupled with a query may cause a deadlock to occur. This deadlock will cause the server to stop processing all requests. A high query rate and/or a high update rate will increase the probability of this condition.\"",

ISC was not able to reproduce this defect in 9.7.2 using -n 1, which causes named to use only one worker thread, thus avoiding the deadlock. If your server is powerful enough to serve your data with a single processor, this option may be fast to implement until you have time to perform an upgrade.\"",
