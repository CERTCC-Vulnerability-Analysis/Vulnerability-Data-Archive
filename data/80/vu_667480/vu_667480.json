  "Description": "AVer Information EH6108H+ hybrid DVR is an IP security camera management system and streaming video recorder. Version X9.03.24.00.07l and possibly earlier are reported to contain multiple vulnerabilities. CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials - CVE-2016-6535 AVer Information EH6108H+ reportedly contains two undocumented, hard-coded account credentials. Both accounts have root privileges and may be used to gain access via an undocumented telnet service that cannot be disabled through the web user interface and runs by default. CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data - CVE-2016-6536 By guessing the handle parameter of the /setup page of the web interface, an unauthenticated attacker reportedly may be able to access restricted pages and alter DVR configurations or change user passwords. CWE-200: Information Exposure - CVE-2016-6537 User credentials are reported to be stored and transmitted in an insecure manner. In the configuration page of the web interface, passwords are stored in base64-encoded strings. In client requests, credentials are listed in plain text in the cookie header. For more information, refer to the researcher's disclosure.",
