  "Overview": "Microsoft Internet Explorer contains a logic error in the way that it handles DHTML. This error makes it possible to move content from the less trusted Restricted zone into the Internet zone. This vulnerability permits an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Internet Zone. In conjunction with other vulnerabilities, it may be possible to execute code in the local computer zone with the privileges of the current user.",
