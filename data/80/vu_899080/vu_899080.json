  "Description": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password - CVE-2015-8286 According to the reporter, DVR devices based on the Zhuhai RaySharp firmware contain a hard-coded root password. Remote attackers with knowledge of the password may gain root access to the device. Furthermore, it was previously reported publicly that many of these devices enable remote access via telnet or port 9000 by default. The CERT/CC has not been able to confirm this information directly with Zhuhai RaySharp. The Vendor List below provides more information on each manufacturer that was reported to be vulnerable. The reporter, Risk Based Security, has provided security advisory RBS-2016-001 with more information.",
