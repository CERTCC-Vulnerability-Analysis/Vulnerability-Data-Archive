  "Resolution": "Modify IIS file permissions\nAccording to Hummingbird: Start Internet Services Manager (IIS). Expand Default Web Site and select CyberDOCS. In the right-hand pane, select an unprotected file with the \".INC\" extension. Right-click and select Properties. On the File tab, clear the check mark from the \"Script source access,\" \"Read,\" and \"Write\" options. Click OK to save the changes. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all remaining unprotected \"*.INC,\" \"*.ASA,\" \"*.LIC,\" \"*.LOG,\" \"*.Settings,\" and \"*.BAK\" files that should be protected. Repeat steps 3 to 6 for other sub-directories that also contain the above unprotected files. NOTE: This process will cause IIS to restart CyberDOCS resulting in all user sessions to be lost.",
