  "Description": "The Accoria web server, also known as Rock Web Server, contains several cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (XSRF) vulnerabilities. Directory traversal and format string vulnerabilities exist as well. The getenv sample code contains an XSS vulnerability when viewed by Internet Explorer 6 or other web browsers that do not follow RFC 2616 Section 7.2.1. Generated cookies appear to be weak and predictable, which may allow an attacker to bypass authentication. Further details are available from the IOActive security advisory.",
