Note that by stopping this service, all users in the NIS domain will be unable to change their NIS password. Enable non-executable user program stacks in the kernel by adding the following lines to the NIS servers \"/etc/system\" file: set noexec_user_stack = 1\n        set noexec_user_stack_log = 1   \nNote that a subsequent reboot is required after this change. Additionally, you must restart the rpc.yppasswd process.",
