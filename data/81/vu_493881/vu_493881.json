  "Workarounds": "Disable the Microsoft OLE DB Row Position Library COM object The most effective way of mitigating this vulnerability appears to be to disable the Microsoft OLE DB Row Position Library COM object. As outlined in the Microsoft Security Advisory, delete the following registry key: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\CLSID\\{2048EEE6-7FA2-11D0-9E6A-00A0C9138C29}] Note that once this change is made, all ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) applications that use the RowPosition property and related information and all OLE DB applications that use the OLE DB Row Position Library will not function properly. Disable Active Scripting This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling Active Scripting in the Internet Zone, as specified in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document. Note that this will not block the vulnerability. IE still may crash when parsing specially crafted XML content. Disabling Active Scripting will mitigate a common method used to achieve code execution with this vulnerability. Enable DEP in Internet Explorer 7 Enabling DEP in Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Vista can help mitigate this vulnerability by making it more difficult to achieve code execution using this vulnerability.",
