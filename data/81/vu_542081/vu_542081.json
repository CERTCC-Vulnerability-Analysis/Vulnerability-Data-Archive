An end-user version of the document is available at http://www.microsoft.com/security/security_bulletins/ms02-065.asp. Note that a vulnerable version of the control may be installed on a Windows system that never had the vulnerable control installed prior to the patch being applied. This is due to the fact that the vulnerable ActiveX control is signed by Microsoft and the patch does not set the kill bit for the MDAC control.",
