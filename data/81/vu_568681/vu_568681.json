AOL update 4194.13.4 contains the fix for U.S. versions of AOL, and 4195.9.4 contains the fix for international versions. This update is also available as a manual install as the Unagi update. The AmpX ActiveX control version 2.6.2.6 also appears to prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability in AOLMediaPlaybackControl.exe from being reached.
