  "Workarounds": "Disable finger service on any systems connected to any NIS based network. Disable access to internal finger services at all perimeter defenses (firewalls, gateways, filtering routers, etc.). If the finger service is required for some specific purpose, limit it to the minimum number of restricted hosts or to hosts which are NOT participating in NIS. For those who wish to continue to run the finger service on their systems, Chok Po of Sun Microsystems has recommended that there are other possible actions that could be taken, like using a public domain fingerd that doesn't do ambiguous lookups. The finger service can also be protected by even something as simple as wrapping finger to not do ambiguous lookups like as follows: # mv /usr/bin/finger /usr/bin/finger.exe\n# cat > /usr/bin/finger\n#!/bin/sh\nexec /usr/bin/finger.exe -m $*\n^D\n# chmod +x /usr/bin/finger",
