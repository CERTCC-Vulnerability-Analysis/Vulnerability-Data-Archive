According to ESi: This vulnerability has been addressed in version 6.0.2 by utilizing a key unique to every customer (these keys existed previously, but were not used). In addition, data encryption is now accomplished using Rinjndael-AES encryption algorithms and hashes are generated with SHA-512 algorithms.
