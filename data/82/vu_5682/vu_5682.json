  "Description": "FROM Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS98-005)\n\nThe software affected by this is Microsoft Office 98 for the Macintosh\n\nThe problem is caused by the way Office 98 allocates space on a disk\nfor local file storage. The Mac OS -- like many other OS' file systems --\ndoes not erase files when you delete them, it simply removes a reference to\nthem in the disk's catalog, and marks the space they occupied as \"free.\"\nOffice 98 does not clear the disk space when the Mac OS allocates it during a\nFile Save operation. Instead, Office 98 simply writes the file contents to\nthe allocated disk space, overwriting any random data that physically\nexisted on the disk. Since the Mac OS allocates the disk space in set chunks,\ncalled clusters, the small amount of unused space at the end of the file's\nlast cluster may contain random data from previously-deleted files. The\ndata cannot be viewed when opened as a native Office file. However, an\nASCII text editor can be used to view the extraneous data.\n \nThe chance that sensitive data will be transferred through this bug is\nunlikely as multiple unusual scenarios must occur.\n\nMicrosoft has produced an update for Office 98 for the Macintosh that\ncompletely eliminates this problem. This update is available from\nMicrosoft's web site, as well as from Microsoft Technical Support. It\nwill be included in all future updates of Office 98 for the Macintosh.",
