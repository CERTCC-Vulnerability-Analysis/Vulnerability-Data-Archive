  "Description": "As discussed in recent conference publications (CanSecWest 2014, Syscan 2014, and Hack-in-the-Box 2014) certain UEFI implementations do  not correctly protect and validate information contained in the 'Setup' UEFI variable. On some systems, this variable can be overwritten using operating system APIs. Exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially lead to bypass of security features, such as secure boot, and/or denial of service for the platform. Please refer to the conference publications for further details.",
