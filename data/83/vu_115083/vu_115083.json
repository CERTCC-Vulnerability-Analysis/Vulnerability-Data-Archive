  "Workarounds": "Disable IGMP and MLD Until updates can be applied disabling IGMP and MLD support may mitigate this vulnerability. See the workarounds section of MS08-001 for more information on disabling IGMP and MLD support in Windows. Block IGMP and MLD Using network or host based firewalls to block IGMP and MLD network traffic may prevent this vulnerability from being remotely exploited. The workarounds section of MS08-001 contains instructions on how to configure the Windows Vista host firewall to block IGMP and MLD. Note that per the Microsoft TechNet article How Windows Firewall Works Windows XP and Server 2003 allow IGMP traffic to pass through the built-in Windows Firewall. Linux system administrators may use the iptables -p parameter to block the IGMP and MLD protocols. Administrators who use PF can set the proto keyword to block the IGMP and MLD protocols. Cisco ASA administrators can disable IGMP support by using the no igmp command as specified in section 11-14 of the Cisco Security Appliance Command Line Configuration Guide.",
