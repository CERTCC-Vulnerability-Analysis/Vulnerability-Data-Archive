Typically, this may be achieved by commenting out the approprate entry in /etc/inetd.conf. As a general practice, CERT/CC recommends disabling any services that are not explicitly required. It is important to carefully consider the consequences of disabling dtspcd in your environment. /etc/inetd.conf\ndtspc stream tcp nowait root /usr/dt/bin/dtspcd /usr/dt/bin/dtspcd\nBlock or Restrict Access Monitor or block external access to 6112/tcp. It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or a similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall may be able to filter requests made to dtspcd.",
