  "Description": "CVE-2013-6026: According to security researcher Craig Heffner, the firmware for various D-Link routers contains a backdoor that allows unauthenticated remote users to bypass the routers' password authentication mechanism. A router's internal web server will accept and process any HTTP requests that contain the User-Agent string \"xmlset_roodkcableoj28840ybtide\" without checking if the connecting host is authenticated. D-Link has confirmed that the affected D-Link routers disable web configuration from the WAN by default. According to D-Link, the following D-Link routers are affected: DIR-100\nDIR-120\nDI-624S\nDI-524UP\nDI-604S\nDI-604UP\nDI-604+\nTM-G5240 According to the original vulnerability report, the following Planex routers are likely affected: BRL-04R\nBRL-04UR\nBRL-04CW It appears that Alpha Networks may be the OEM for routers branded by D-Link and Planex (and probably other vendors). It is not clear where in the supply chain the backdoor was added, so routers from any of these vendors may be affected. CVE-2013-6027: A separate stack overflow vulnerability in the management web server has also been reported.",

The administrative web server may listen on ports 80/tcp or 8080/tcp. D-Link has confirmed that the affected D-Link routers disable web configuration from the WAN by default. There is some evidence that at least one ISP may have deployed vulnerable routers with the remote WAN management enabled.",
