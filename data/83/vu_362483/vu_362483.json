  "Impact": "Given a certain set of preconditions, an attacker can pass packets through the firewall. Specifically, an external attacker can only communicate with an internal host that has previously initiated an outbound connection, and can only communicate on the port the internal host allocated for that initial outbound connection. Given the ability to pass traffic across the protective boundary, an intruder may be able to reach hosts that would normally be protected behind the firewall boundary. If an intruder can gain control of a host inside the firewall, he may be able to use this vulnerability to tunnel arbitrary traffic across the firewall boundary. Finally, Cisco has indicated in their advisory that \"Depending on the exact session parameters, it may be possible to send data to processes that were supposed to be accessible only from within the trusted network.\"",
