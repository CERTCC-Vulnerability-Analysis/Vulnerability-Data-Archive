  "Description": "Service Location Protocol is an IETF standards track protocol that provides a framework to allow networking applications to discover the existence, location, and configuration of networked services in enterprise networks. The OpenSLP project is an effort to develop an open-source implementation of Service Location Protocol. When OpenSLP parses a SLP packet containing malformed extensions the extensions parser will enter an infinite loop causing a denial-of-service condition. If an attacker creates a packet containing a \"next extension offset\" pointing to itself or to a previous extension, the extension's parser will enter an infinite loop consuming 100% of the CPU.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade or apply a patch from the vendor Patches and updated versions of the software have been released to address this issue. Please see the Vendor Information section of this document for more information. Users who compile their OpenSLP software from the svn distribution should checkout to the latest svn revision. According to the revision update this vulnerability has been resolved in revision 1647.",
