  "Description": "There is a security hole in Red Hat 2.1, which installs the program\n/usr/bin/resizecons suid root.  The resizecons program allows a user\nto change the videmode of the console.  During this process, it runs\nthe program restoretextmode without an absolute pathname, assuming the\ncorrect version will be found in the path, while running with root\nprivileges.  It then executes setfont in the same manner.  By setting\nthe path to find a rogue restoretextmode, a user can execute an arbitrary\nprogram as root.\n   As a more amusing aside, the file /tmp/selection.pid is read and the\npid contained within is sent a SIGWINCH, allowing a user on the system\nto force a redraw of the screen to an arbitrary process (that handles \nSIGWINCH calls) on the machine. \n   If /usr/bin/resizecons needs to be run by users other than root at the\nconsole, provisions need to be made in the code to execute the outside\nutilities with absolute pathnames, and to check access rights on files\nbefore opening.\n\n                   Program: /usr/bin/resizecons\nAffected Operating Systems: Red Hat 2.1 linux distribution\n              Requirements: account on system\n           Temporary Patch: chmod -s /usr/bin/resizecons\n       Security Compromise: root\n                    Author: Dave M. (davem@cmu.edu)\n                  Synopsis: resizecons runs restoretextmode without an\n                            absolute pathname while executing as root,\n                            allowing a user to substitute the real\n                            program with arbitrary commands.",
