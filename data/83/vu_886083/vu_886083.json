  "Overview": "SecurityFocus and CORE Security Technologies have reported a vulnerability in WU-FTPD. WU-FTPD does not handle file name globbing properly and may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. WU-FTPD is a widely-used FTP daemon that is included in many UNIX and Linux distributions. This vulnerability was discussed on SecurityFocus' vuln-dev mailing list in April 2001.",
