  "Overview": "Wu-ftpd is a popular package which provided file transfer service on many Unix-based systems. It has been reported that when an ftp daemon is configured to allow guest access on a RedHat 7.0 or 7.1 system, any local or remote chrooted user can delete root-owned files on the system within the root filesystem accessible to the ftpd daemon (i.e., chrooted environments limit the scope of this vulnerability being exploited); this may present the risk of some denial of the ftp service or further security problems.",
