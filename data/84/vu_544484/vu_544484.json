Disable or Restrict HTTP Access Disable the HTTP server or restrict network access to it. Note that the web interface may also be listening on port 443/tcp. If the HTTP server is not enabled, the local user list feature can safely be configured via the command line interface. See the workarounds section of Cisco security advisory cisco-sa-20060628-ap for detailed information on how to implement these workarounds.",
