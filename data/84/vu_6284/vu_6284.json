  "Description": "Under Solaris, you can mount a loopback filesystem.  That is, you\ncan \"remount\" part of an already-mounted file system somewhere else.\n\nWe use this feature to loopback and mount some directories for network\nservers.  We mount the directory read-only.  So, for instance, the ftp\ndaemon actually chroots to a file system that is mounted \"read-only\" at\nat the point where it mounts it, but the file system is still writeable\nfor us local users.  Let me put names on this to be specific.\nThe COAST archive is a directory on a local disk partition, /u/coast3.\nWe loopback mount /u/coast3/ftp back on /ftp read-only, and make\nthe ftp daemon chroot to this directory.  Locally, we can modify\nthe directory /u/coast3/ftp to maintain the archive, but (theoretically)\neven if someone breaks through the ftp server, they can only access\nthe read-only /ftp mount point.\n\nAnyhow, that's how it should work.  We know that many other sites use a\nsimilar mechanism for ftp, gopher, and WWW sites.\n\nThe problem is that under Solaris 2.x (for various values of x,\nincluding x = 2 and x = 3), the readonly feature doesn't work with\nloopback file systems.  You can still modify existing files, or create\nnew ones, if you have otherwise appropriate permissions.  The only\neffect the \"readonly\" attribute seems to have is that you cannot create\nnew files.  It even updates the inode times for changes....\n\nThis is clearly a bug.  It was reported to Sun 5 months ago.  I spoke\nwith Mark Graff earlier today, and he is unaware of a fix.  He is also\ntoo busy with more pressing problems to even pursue this.  A fix may\nnot be coming soon.",
