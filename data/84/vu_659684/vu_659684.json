  "Description": "The Honeywell OPOS Suite provides a standard programming interface that allows POS hardware to be easily integrated into retail POS systems based on Microsoft Windows operating systems. Honeywell OPOS Suite versions prior to version 1.13.4.15 are vulnerable to stack buffer overflows in HWOPOSScale.ocx and HWOPOSSCANNER.ocx. In both HWOPOSScale.ocx and HWOPOSSCANNER.ocx, the controls do not check the length of an attacker-supplied string to the Open method before copying it into a fixed length buffer on the stack. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser process. These issues are being tracked by the Zero Day Initiative as ZDI-CAN-2528 and ZDI-CAN-2527. These vulnerabilities affect the same component and are therefore jointly assigned CVE-2014-8269.",
