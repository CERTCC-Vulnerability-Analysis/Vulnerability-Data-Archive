  "Impact": "The unpack() function is not normally passed user-supplied data, and so the scope of this vulnerability is limited to specifically crafted malicious PHP scripts. However, such a script may enable an attacker to observe information on the heap. This may also enable an attacker to bypass canary-based heap runtime protection (in conjunction with VU#825816).",
