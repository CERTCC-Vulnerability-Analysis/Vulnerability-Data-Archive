  "Workarounds": "Do not access Java Applets from untrusted sources Attackers must deliver a malicious Java applet to a vulnerable system in order to take advantage of this vulnerability. By only accessing Java applets from known and trusted sources the chances of exploitation are reduced. Disable Java in web browser Java applets are commonly executed within a web browser. Disabling Java within the web browser may prevent an attacker from delivering a malicious applet to a vulnerable system.",
