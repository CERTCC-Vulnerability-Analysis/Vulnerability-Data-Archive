  "Description": "CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The Cerberus FTP Server web interface is vulnerable to CSRF using the HTTP POST method in the <targetip>:10000/usermanager/users/modify. The application has web based administration which allows authorized administrators to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without making proper validity checks to verify the source of the requests.This can be exploited to add, delete, modify or stop the FTP service, for example to add a user.",
