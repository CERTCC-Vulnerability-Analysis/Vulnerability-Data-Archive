  "Description": "On all of these systems, Digital have added flags to\nmountd (-s and -d) which can be used to prevent clients outside the\nlocal domain from mounting filing systems. In simple tests\nthese appear to work.\n\nHowever there is a caching bug. If a request from a foreign\ndomain is rejected, and then tried again before the mount\ndaemon receives a request from a different client, the\ndomain check will be bypassed and the request will succeed",
