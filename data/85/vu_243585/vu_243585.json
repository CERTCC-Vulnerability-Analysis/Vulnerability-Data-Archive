  "Description": "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\nCWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength Some implementations of SSL/TLS accept export-grade (512-bit or smaller) RSA keys even when not specifically requesting export grade ciphers. This can occur when a MiTM attacker asks for export grade ciphers on behalf of a client, and the client insecurely accepts the export grade key. The attacker can then factor the weak RSA key and use this key to decrypt other data necessary to generate the session key. The attacker can then decrypt data in the session. The researchers provide a more detailed explanation on their website.",

  "Overview": "Some implementations of SSL/TLS accept export-grade (512-bit or smaller) RSA keys even when not specifically requesting export grade ciphers. An attacker able to act as a Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) could factor weak temporary RSA keys, obtain session keys, and decrypt SSL/TLS trafflc. This issue has been dubbed the \"FREAK\" (Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys) attack.",
