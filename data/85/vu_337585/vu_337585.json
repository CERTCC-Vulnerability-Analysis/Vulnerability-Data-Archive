  "Impact": "An attacker with the ability to inject malicious script may be able to steal sensitive user data including a user's authentication credentials (usernames and passwords), private Pubcookie data including a user's authentication assertion (\"granting\") cookies, and single sign-on (SSO or \"login\") session cookies. An attacker injecting HTML tags using the vulnerability may also be able to deface a site's Pubcookie login page for a single instance (viewing) of the page.",
