Right-click the web server, then choose Properties, then Master Properties, then WWW Service. 3. Choose Edit, then HomeDirectory, then Configuration\n\t4. Remove the .HTR entry\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, in addition to .HTR, Microsoft also recommends removing several other so-called script mappings. Apply the appropriate vendor patch: IIS 4.0:  http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=27492\nIIS 5.0:  http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=27491\nNote that these are the most recent patches as referenced in MS01-004. CERT/CC also recommends the following documents on the secure configuration of Windows NT/2000 and IIS: Windows NT Configuration Guidelines\nWindows NT Security and Configuration Resources\nIIS 4.0 Security Checklist\nSecure Internet Information Services 5 Checklist",
