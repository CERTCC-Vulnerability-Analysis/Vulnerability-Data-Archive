Disable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Internet Explorer will not use the vulnerable DirectX Transform filters when ActiveX controls are disabled. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the document Securing Your Web Browser. Note that disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites.",
