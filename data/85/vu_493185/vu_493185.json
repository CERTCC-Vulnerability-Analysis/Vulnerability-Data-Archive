  "Workarounds": "Do not open untrusted Excel documents Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Excel or other Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip ST04-010. Do not rely on file name extension filtering In most cases, Windows will call Excel to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if spreadsheet.qwer contains the correct file header information, Windows will open spreadsheet.qwer with Excel. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .xls, .xlt, .csv) will not detect all Excel documents.",
