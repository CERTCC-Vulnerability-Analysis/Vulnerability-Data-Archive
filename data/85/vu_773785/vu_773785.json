  "Impact": "An attacker who can convince a user to access a specially crafted URI could cause script or HTML of the attacker's choice to be executed in the user's browser. The script or HTML would run in the context of the vulnerable site. Using this technique, an attacker may be able to take actions with the privileges of the user who accessed the URI, such as reading sensitive information or modifying the appearance or operation of a vulnerable site.",
