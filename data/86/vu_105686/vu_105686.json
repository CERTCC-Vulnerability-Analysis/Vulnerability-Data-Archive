  "Description": "The 7 Elements advisory states that the Thecus NAS server N8800 device contains the following vulnerabilities: CVE-2013-5667 - Thecus NAS Server N8800 Firmware 5.03.01 get_userid OS Command Injection\nThe application accepts user input through the get_userid parameter that can be used to create OS commands that are redirected to the operating system. An attacker can use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands. CVE-2013-5668 - Thecus NAS Server N8800 Firmware 5.03.01\nThe Domain Administrator Password within the ADS/NT Support page is disclosed due to clear text storage of sensitive information within the GUI. Any user who has access to this page is able to retrieve the ADS/NT administrator ID and password. This could enable an attacker to gain access to the domain hosting the storage server. CVE-2013-5669 - Thecus NAS Server N8800 Firmware 5.03.01 plain text administrative password\nThe Administration Web Page transmits passwords in cleartext, which allows remote attackers to sniff the administrative password. Additional details may be found in the 7 Elements advisory. The CVSS score below is for CVE-2013-5667.",
