  "VendorStatement": "Check Point Statement on SNMP Vulnerability Test Suite Recently, an automated suite has been released which tests products for known SNMP vulnerabilities. FireWall-1, by default, blocks all SNMP communication to, from, or across a FireWall-1 gateway. SNMP communication is enabled only if the administrator writes a specific rule which allows the communication. SNMP communication is not required for correct functionality of any Check Point products. If SNMP monitoring of Check Point firewalls is needed, Check Point recommends that the FireWall-1 rule base tightly restrict SNMP communication and that all relevant operating system security patches be applied. Check Point knows of no SNMP-related security issues in any of its products, and has conducted an extensive review to ensure that none exist.",
