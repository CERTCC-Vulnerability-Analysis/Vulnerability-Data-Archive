  "Description": "CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\nIt has been reported that the 'Properties.do?name='  module is vulnerable to an \u2018unauthorized function call\u2019 caused by server failing to properly verify the privilege level of user (ie; Admin, User, or Guest). This could allow a lower privileged user (ie Guest, User) to modify the hidden \u2018edit\u2019  boolean parameter  to \u2018true\u2019, to gain Admin level authority allowing them to make modification to device name and other information. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\nIt has been reported that the module name, mentioned above is also vulnerable to XSS injection by storing malformed name/malicious script provided by user. This malicious name is redistributed across subsequent  tabs and subdomain pages in the form of an executable web element.",

Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location.",
