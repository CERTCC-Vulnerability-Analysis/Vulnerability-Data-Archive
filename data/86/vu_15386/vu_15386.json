  "Description": "Here is a nifty security hole under HP-UX 10.X (haven't tried under\n9.X yet).  SAM will create a VERY EASILY guessed tempfile,\n/var/tmp/bdf.err, anytime you inventory your logical volumes.  Since\n/var/tmp is installed mode 777, ANY user can create a symbolic link\nto ANY file and then zero out that file when someone uses SAM.  So:",
