  "Description": "FROM Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS98-015):\n\nThe \"Untrusted Scripted Paste\" issue involves a vulnerability in Internet\nExplorer that could allow a malicious hacker to circumvent certain Internet\nExplorer security safeguards. This vulnerability makes it possible for a\nmalicious Web site operator to read the contents of a file on the user's\ncomputer if the hacker knows the exact name and path of the targeted file.\nThis could also be used to view the contents of a file on the user's network\nto which the user has access, and whose direct path name is known by the\nattacker.\n \nThe nature of this problem is that a script is able to use the\nDocument.ExecCommand function to paste a filename into the file upload\nintrinsic control, which should only be possible by explicit user action. As\na result, a subsequent form submission could send the file to a remote web\nsite unbeknownst to the user if the user has disabled the default warning\nthat is displayed when submitting unencrypted forms (see \"Administrative\nWorkaround\" below for information on re-enabling this functionality).\n \nWhile there have not been any reports of customers being adversely affected\nby these problems, Microsoft is releasing a patch to address any risks posed\nby this issue.",
