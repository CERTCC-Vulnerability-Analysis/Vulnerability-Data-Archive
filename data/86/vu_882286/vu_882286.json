  "Description": "CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk - CVE-2013-3585\nWeb Viewer for Samsung DVR stores user credentials in plaintext allowing an attacker to parse saved credentials on the user setup webpage. CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data - CVE-2013-3586\nWeb Viewer for Samsung DVR contains a vulnerability in its cookie-handling procedure that accepts any input as a valid session ID if placed after SessionID=. This allows an attacker to send a specially crafted cookie containing an malicious SessionID to the web server which bypasses authentication and can provide access to internal pages, including camera controls and account settings. For example: headers = { \"Cookie\": \"=\", \"Accept\": \"text/plain\"} The CVSS score below reflects the authentication bypass attack.",
