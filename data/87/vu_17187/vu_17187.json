  "Description": "The CERT advisory of November 4 called out a vunerability in the sendmail\nprogram that could be exploited to give unauthorized remote or local users the\nability to execute programs as any system user other than root.\n\nWe have confirmed that the versions of sendmail included in IRIX 4.x and 5.x do\nnot have this particular vulnerability. The approach used can however be\nslightly modified in such a way as to allow a user to read the contents of\nfiles that they might not have read permission to by using sendmail.",
