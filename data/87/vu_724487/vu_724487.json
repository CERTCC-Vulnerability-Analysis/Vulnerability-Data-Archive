  "Description": "According to the reporter, the Fortinet FortiWAN network load balancer appliance contains the following vulnerabilities. CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') - CVE-2016-4965 The diagnosis_control.php page is vulnerable to command injection via the \"graph\" GET parameter. A non-administrative authenticated attacker having access privileges to the nslookup functionality can inject arbitrary operating system commands and execute them in the context of the root user. CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data - CVE-2016-4966 The diagnosis_control.php page has a tcpdump function, that can capture FortiWAN data packets and download captured packets to local host for analysis and debug. A non-administrative authenticated attacker having access privileges to change the HTTP Get param \u201cUserName\u201d to \u201cAdministrator\u201d to download a PCAP file of all captured packets from the FortinWAN device since the tcpdump function was activated. CWE-200: Information Exposure - CVE-2016-4967 An authenticated but low privileged user may obtain a backup of the device configuration by visiting the URL /script/cfg_show.php of the FortiWAN appliance, or a PCAP of tcpdump data by visiting /script/system/tcpdump.php. CWE-200: Information Exposure - CVE-2016-4968 An authenticated but low privileged user may perform a GET request of the /linkreport/tmp/admin_global page of the FortiWAN appliance, and obtain administrator login cookie. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CVE-2016-4969 The /script/statistics/getconn.php file's IP parameter is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2016-4965.",
