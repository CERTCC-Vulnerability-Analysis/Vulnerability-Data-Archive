  "Impact": "An attacker with the ability to modify Kerberos Telnet negotiation commands sent from server to client may be able to cause the connection to negotiate less secure authentication and encryption options, including no encryption. The attacker may then be able to read data that the user presumes to be securely encrypted. This is exacerbated by another vulnerability in KTH Kerberos Telnet clients. When a user requests encryption and the server does not appear to support it, KTH Kerberos Telnet clients continue negotiation and establish a connection with no encryption (VU#390280).",

  "Workarounds": "Enforce Client Encryption Preference One defense against the attacks described in Josefsson's paper is to strictly enforce the client's preferences and abort the connection if authentication or encryption cannot be negotiated. The following is an excerpt from a man page entry for a BSD-derived telnet command option to enable data encryption: -x  Turn on encryption of the data stream. When this option is turned on,  tel-\n        net  will  exit  with  an error if authentication cannot be negotiated or if\n        encryption cannot be turned on. Josefsson references a patch for the KTH Kerberos V (Heimdal) implementation that enforces the client's encryption preference.",

  "Overview": "A vulnerability exists in the Telnet Authentication Option and Telnet Data Encryption Option specifications. An ordered list of authentication and encryption options sent from the server to client during negotiation is not cryptographically protected. As a result, an attacker may be able to modify the list and cause less secure authentication and encryption options to be negotiated. An active attacker may be able to disable Telnet data encryption without the client's knowledge.",
