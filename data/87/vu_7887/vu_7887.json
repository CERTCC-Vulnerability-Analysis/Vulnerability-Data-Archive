  "Description": "From the HP Security Bulletin:\n\nHP SharedX Receiver Service (recserv) provides a method for a\n      receiver to allow the sharing of windows without explicitly\n      performing any xhost commands.  The Internet daemon, inetd,\n      executes recserv when it receives a service request at the port\n      listed in the services database.  Certain messages to the port\n      can cause recserv to enter a tight processing loop",
