  "Description": "Brocade Vyatta 5400 vRouter versions 6.4R(x), 6.6R(x), and 6.7R1 contain the following vulnerabilities: CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') - CVE-2014-4868\nThe Vyatta 5400 vRouter provides a restricted management console for authenticated users to administer the device. By issuing back tick (`) characters with certain commands, an authenticated user can break out of the management shell and gain access to the underlying Linux shell. The user can then run arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges afforded by their account. CWE-284: Improper Access Control - CVE-2014-4869\nThe default permissions granted to users in the \"operator\" group allow them to access files containing sensitive information, such as encrypted passwords. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2014-4870\nThe default configuration also allows non-root users to run scripts in the /opt/vyatta/bin/sudo-users/ directory with elevated (sudo) permissions. Certain input parameters to the /opt/vyatta/bin/sudo-users/vyatta-clear-dhcp-lease.pl script are not properly validated. A malicious unprivileged user can run the script with elevated permissions and leverage its improper input validation condition to spawn an attacker-controlled shell with root privileges. The CVSS score reflects CVE-2014-4870.",
