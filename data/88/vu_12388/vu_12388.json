  "Description": "The listen(2) system call used for setting up TCP sockets\nfor TCP servers has an extremely limited number of pending half-open\nconnections available. The relevant kernel parameter is SOMAXCONN.\n\nSOMAXCONN is now typically set to 5. Eric suggests that it should be\nat least 128 but Ken Adelman (Adelman@TGV.COM) points out this opens\na different denial of service attack>  \"now a machine sending you\nSYN packets is going to tie up a significant amount of memory resources\n(mbufs) in the kernel handling these 1/2 connections. In machines with\nlimited mbuf space, this could be a problem.  For example, a typical\nmachine running our TCP/IP product would have 30 listens pending.\nTimes 128 connections and 128 bytes-per mbuf (3 per connection) is\nalmost 1.5MB; far more than the 512K default we (or the BSD kernel\ntypically) allows for this.\"\n\nThis kind of attack is impossible to trace to its source without a\nhop-by-hop monitoring of the network paths, beginning at the attacked\nhost, because no established two-way communication path is required.\nIf it were multisource, well...",
