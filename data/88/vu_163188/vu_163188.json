  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. Do not follow unsolicited links Do not click on unsolicited URLs received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. While this is generally good security practice, following this behavior will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting.",
