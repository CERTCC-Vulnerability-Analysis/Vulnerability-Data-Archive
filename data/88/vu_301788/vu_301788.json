  "Description": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key - CVE-2014-4875\nToshiba CHEC, versions 6.6, 6.7, and possibly earlier, contain a hard-coded cryptographic key in the CreateBossCredentials.jar file. An attacker that can access the bossinfo.pro file may be able to use the hard-coded AES key to decrypt its contents, including the BOSS database credentials.",
