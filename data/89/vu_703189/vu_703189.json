  "Description": "The Invensys Wonderware Archestra ConfigurationAccessComponent ActiveX control, ConfigurationAccessComponent.dll, used by the Wonderware Archestra IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and the InFusion IEE (Integrated Engineering Environment) contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. The UnsubscribeData method of the IConfigurationAccess interface uses wcscpy() to copy its first parameter into a static sized local buffer.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade\nAccording to Invensys, users who are using IAS 2.1 (all versions)-IDE, WAS 3.0 (all versions)-IDE, WAS 3.1 (all versions)-IDE, InFusion CE 2.0-IEE, InFusion FE 1.0 (all versions)-IEE, InFusion FE 2.0-IEE, or InFusion SCADA 2.0\u2013IEE should apply the vendor security update. This vulnerability is not present in Wonderware Application Server 3.1 Service Pack 2 Patch 01 (WAS 3.1 SP2 P01). Disable the ConfigurationAccessComponent ActiveX control in Internet Explorer The ConfigurationAccessComponent ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID: {55414847-A533-4642-8E92-76B191B24B87} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{55414847-A533-4642-8E92-76B191B24B87}]\n\"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{55414847-A533-4642-8E92-76B191B24B87}]\n\"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\nDisable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document.\u00a0",
