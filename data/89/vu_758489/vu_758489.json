  "Description": "Exim is a message transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet. If Exim is built without specifying the ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY configuration option, then the Exim user can invoke Exim with an arbitrary configuration file. The Exim developers note that this option is unspecified by default. Consequently, any ${run...} directives specified in that configuration file will be executed as root. Note: this vulnerability has been reported being exploited in the wild.",
