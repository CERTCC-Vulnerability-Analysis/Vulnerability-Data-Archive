  "Workarounds": "Disable Autorun To help protect yourself against software running without your consent, disable Autorun as described in Microsoft Support Document 155217. This will prevent Windows from automatically running software when CD or DVD media is inserted. Use least privilege Use \"least privilege\" approach to user accounts. By reducing the privileges of the user accounts, the impact of this and other vulnerabilties may be reduced. More information about this technique is available in the Microsoft TechNet article Applying the Principle of Least Privilege to User Accounts on Windows XP.",
