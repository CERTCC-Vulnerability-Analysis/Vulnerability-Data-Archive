  "Description": "Who is affected? All versions of OpenSSL supporting TLS extensions contain this vulnerability including OpenSSL 0.9.8f through 0.9.8o, 1.0.0, 1.0.0a releases. Any OpenSSL based TLS server is vulnerable if it is multi-threaded and uses OpenSSL's internal caching mechanism. Servers that are multi-process and/or disable internal session caching are NOT affected. In particular the Apache HTTP server (which never uses OpenSSL internal caching) and Stunnel (which includes its own workaround) are NOT affected.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade or apply a patch from the vendor Patches and updated versions of the software have been released to address this issue. Please see the Vendor Information section of this document for more information. Users of all OpenSSL 0.9.8 releases from 0.9.8f through 0.9.8o should update\nto the OpenSSL 0.9.8p release which contains a patch to correct this issue. Users of OpenSSL 1.0.0 and 1.0.0a should update to the OpenSSL 1.0.0b release\nwhich contains a patch to correct this issue. If upgrading is not immediately possible, the relevant source code patch\nprovided in this advisory should be applied.",
