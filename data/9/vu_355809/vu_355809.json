Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{917623D1-D8E5-11D2-BE8B-00104B06BDE3}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\nPlease note that setting the kill bit will remove some of the Internet Explorer functionality provided by the Axis software. Disable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities.
