  "Description": "FROM:  Cisco security notice: Cisco PIX and CBAC Fragmentation attack\n\nNeither Cisco's PIX Firewall, nor the Context-Based Access Control (CBAC)\nfeature of Cisco's IOS Firewall Feature Set, protects hosts against certain\ndenial of service attacks involving fragmented IP packets. This\nvulnerability does not permit network \"breakins\". The vulnerability is most\nsevere in configurations involving static NAT entries, or in configurations\nnot involving any use of NAT.\n \nThe vulnerability is present in Cisco PIX firewall software up to and\nincluding version 4.2(1), and in CBAC versions of Cisco IOS software through\n11.2P and 11.3T, and will be present in initial 12.0 revisions of CBAC\nsoftware.\n \nThe Cisco Centri firewall does not share this vulnerability.",
