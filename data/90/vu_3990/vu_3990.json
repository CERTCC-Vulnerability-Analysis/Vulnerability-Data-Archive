  "Description": "Cisco offers a web caching product called the Cisco Cache Engine(CCE).\nTo use this engine you enable  Cisco's Web Caching Control Protocol(WCCP)\non a router, point the CCE at the router and the router will automatically\nencapsulate any web requests with GRE and forward them to the CCE.\n\nWCCP operates entirely at the IP level  and will tunnel web packets to the\nCache Engine if it is not on a local network.  WCCP has no security\nbuilt in. It seems feasible for a malicious third party to backward engineer\nWCCP and with it be able to redirect web packets from\nany router running WCCP. \n\nCurrently anyone with a CCE can point it at any router running WCCP and\nreceive all the web packets going through that router.\n\n\nThis is an obvious hole that most people will not think of before they\ninstall WCCP.",
