  "Description": "Raw disk IO through the IOCTL requires only group read access to write\nto the device.\n\nIf you break operator on SunOS and have read on a raw SCSI device, you\ncan use the IOCTL descriptor to do raw disk IO regardless of the file\npermission on the device.  Tsutomo has successfully used this method\nto format a disk, and write to specific sectors.\n\nOn NeXT systems, there is a generic SCSI device (sg).  Using the above\nvulnerability on an sg device will give you write access to *any* SCSI\ndevice attached to the system.\n\nFolks from Thinking Machines have also reported this problem\nagainst Sun.",
