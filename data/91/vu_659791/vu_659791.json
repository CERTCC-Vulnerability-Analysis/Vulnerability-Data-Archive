  "Description": "The IBM security advisories state: CVE-2012-2955\n\"The administrative user interface contains pages where it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript code contained in an HTTP request query string (Reflected XSS). If the HTTP request is executed in the web interface after a user has authenticated, the attacker could access cookies, files, or session information. To be successful, this requires the attacker to have specific information about the installed product.\" CVE-2012-2202\n\"An Arbitrary File Read is possible on the javatester_init.php page by passing an unvalidated parameter after authentication has occurred. It enables an administrative user to access file content otherwise inaccessible through the administrative web interface.\" Additional details may be found in the full advisories linked above.",
