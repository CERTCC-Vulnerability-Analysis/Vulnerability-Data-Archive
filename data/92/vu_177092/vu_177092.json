  "Description": "KCodes NetUSB is a Linux kernel module that provides USB over IP. It is used to provide USB device sharing on a home user network. CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') - CVE-2015-3036 According to the reporter, computer client data provided when connecting to the NetUSB server is not properly validated by the driver before processing, resulting in a buffer overflow that may lead to a denial of service or code execution. More information can be found in SEC Consult's advisory. The NetUSB driver provided by KCodes has been integrated into several vendors' products. For more information, please see the Vendor Information section below. CERT/CC has been unable to confirm this information directly with KCodes.",
