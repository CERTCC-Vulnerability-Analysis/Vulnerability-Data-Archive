  "Workarounds": "Do not open playlist files from untrusted sources Do not open untrusted playlist files (.PLS or .M3U) with VUPlayer. Do Not Follow Unsolicited Links In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases.",
