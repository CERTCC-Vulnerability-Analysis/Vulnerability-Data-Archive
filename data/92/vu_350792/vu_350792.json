  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a system running krb524d. In many cases, this system also operates a KDC, so this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain the master secret for a Kerberos realm, leading to compromise of the entire realm. An attacker may also be able to crash a system running krb524d, causing a denial of service.",

  "Overview": "The MIT Kerberos krb524d daemon does not securely deallocate heap memory when handling an error condition, resulting in a double-free vulnerability. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a system running krb524d, which in many cases is also a Kerberos Distribution Center (KDC). The compromise of a KDC system can lead to the compromise of an entire Kerberos realm. An attacker may also be able to cause a denial of service on a system running krb524d.",
