  "Description": "An XSS vulnerability exists in the Historian Web Administrator because it lacks server-side validation of query string parameter values. Attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities require that a user visit a specially crafted URL, which injects client-side scripts into the server\u2019s HTTP response to the client. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain information and to execute arbitrary client-side scripts to support further attacks.
