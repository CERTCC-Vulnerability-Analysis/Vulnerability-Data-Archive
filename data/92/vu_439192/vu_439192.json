  "Description": "According to Control Microsystems ClearSCADA's website: \"ClearSCADA is an integrated SCADA host platform that includes a polling engine, real-time database, historian, web server, alarm redirection for text messaging and email and a reporting package.\" According to ICS-CERT Advisory ICSA-10-314-01A, there are three vulnerabilities in ClearSCADA: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the ClearSCADA application. The overflow identified is a \u201cuse after free\u201d type heap overflow. Reliable heap corruption was discovered by sending overly long strings following a valid packet. This heap overflow can cause a denial of service condition for the ClearSCADA application, or it could be leveraged for remote code execution. ClearSCADA provides a web interface that supports both HTTP (plain-text) and HTTPS (encrypted) for remote connections. By default, the ClearSCADA server uses HTTP; this allows anyone with access to the connection between the client and server to view authentication credentials in plain text (unsecure). The web interface is vulnerable to reflective (nonpersistent) cross-site scripting. Using this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code directly into the user's browsing session. Parameters are passed back to the user without being properly sanitized. Note: This Advisory also applies to all versions of SCX (from Serck UK or Serck Aus) that are older than the following (these SCX versions bundle ClearSCADA in the package): SCX Version 67 R4.5\nSCX Version 68 R3.9.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade ClearSCADA Users Control Microsystems recommends that ClearSCADA 2009 users obtain service packs for ClearSCADA 2009 R2.3 and ClearSCADA 2009 R1.4. Control Microsystems also recommends that users upgrade ClearSCADA 2005 (all versions) and ClearSCADA 2007 (all versions) as soon as possible to the updated versions listed below. ClearSCADA 2010 R1\nClearSCADA 2009 R2.3\nClearSCADA 2009 R1.4. Serck SCX Users SCX users should contact the nearest Serck office to obtain updates.",
