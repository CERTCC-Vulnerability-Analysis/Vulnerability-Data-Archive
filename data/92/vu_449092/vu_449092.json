This can be accomplished by deleting the following registry key: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Winamp.Playlist\nDisable Shoutcast and Ultravox protocols Links to malicious playlist files may be accessed using the Shoutcast (shout:) or Ultravox (uvox:) protocols. Disabling these protocols will reduce the chances of exploitation. This can be accomplished by deleting the following registry keys: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ICY\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\SC\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\SHOUT\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\UVOX\nDo not open Winamp playlist files Do not open Winamp playlist files (.PLS or .M3U) from untrusted sources.",
