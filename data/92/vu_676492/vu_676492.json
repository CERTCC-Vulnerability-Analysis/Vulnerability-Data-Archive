  "Description": "Wireshark is a protocol analyzer that can open or import previously saved files. When processing an Endace ERF file an unsigned integer wrap vulnerability may cause Wireshark to allocate a very large buffer. To exploit this issue, an attacker would have to convince a user to open a crafted ERF file using Wireshark. This issue also affects Tshark, the console version of Wireshark.",
