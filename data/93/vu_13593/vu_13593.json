  "Description": "SUN's DECnet emulation program (DNI) gives incorrect\nfile permissions to files transferred to a DECNET host.\nDNICP will copy a file from a SUN unix platform to the VAX via\nDECnet.  It will set the RWE bits for the OWNER, GROUP and WORLD\nUIC based protections to correspond to a protection that is equivalent\nto the one defined on the SUN.  But, in all cases, it will grant\ndelete access to all categories.  In addition, default directory and\nACE specified protections will be overridden.",
