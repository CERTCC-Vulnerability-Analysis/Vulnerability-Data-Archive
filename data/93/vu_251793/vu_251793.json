  "Description": "Foxit Reader is software designed to view Portable Document Format (PDF) files. Foxit Reader contains multiple vulnerabilities in the handling of JPX (JPEG2000) streams. These vulnerabilities may result in memory corruption. Note: Foxit Reader does not contain the ability to decode JPEG2000 data by default. The JPEG2000 / JBIG Decoder add-on must be installed for Foxit Reader to be vulnerable. When Foxit Reader encounters a PDF document that has JPEG2000 or JBIG data, the user will automatically be prompted to install the add-on, however.", 
  "CVSS_AccessComplexity": "M", 
  "CVSS_SecurityRequirementsAR": "ND", 
  "Resolution": "Apply an update This issue is addressed in Foxit Reader 3.0 Build 1817. Updating to this version should trigger the process to upgrade the JPEG2000 / JBIG Decoder component to be updated to version 2.0.2009.616 if a vulnerable version is already installed. Additional details are available in the Foxit Reader security advisory.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable JavaScript in Foxit Reader Disabling JavaScript may help prevent this and other vulnerabilities from being exploited. Foxit Reader JavaScript can be disabled in the preferences dialog (Edit -> Preferences -> JavaScript and uncheck Enable JavaScript Actions). Note that this will not block the vulnerability. Foxit Reader still may crash when parsing specially crafted PDF documents. Prevent Internet Explorer from automatically opening PDF documents The installer for Foxit Reader configures Internet Explorer to automatically open PDF files without any user interaction. This behavior can be reverted to the safer option of prompting the user by importing the following as a .REG file: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\FoxitReader.Document] \"EditFlags\"=hex:00,00,00,00 Disable the displaying of PDF documents in the web browser Preventing PDF documents from opening inside a web browser may help mitigate this vulnerability. If this workaround is applied to updated versions of the Foxit reader, it may help mitigate future vulnerabilities. To prevent PDF documents from automatically being opened in a web browser: Open Foxit Reader. Open the Edit menu. Choose the Preferences option. Choose the Internet section. Uncheck the \"Display PDF in browser\" check box. Do not access PDF documents from untrusted sources Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected PDF documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip ST04-010.",
