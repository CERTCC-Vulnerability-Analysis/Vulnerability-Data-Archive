  "Description": "/usr/sbin/aspppd is the daemon that handles PPP traffic.  The\nlatest patch version for this program is 104516-03.  The program\nuses a FIFO that is located in /tmp/.asppp.fifo.\n\nThe FIFO file is mode 666.  If you cat a large file through this\nfile, then you can kill network connections.\n\nIf you try to protect this file by setting the umask to 022 in\n/etc/rc2.d/S47asppp, then the umask for the daemon is apparently\nstill not modified, and further, it will crash the daemon.\n\nThe release notes for the previous patch level note that\ninstallation of 104516-02 causes aspppd to not start properly.",
