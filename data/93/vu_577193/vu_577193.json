  "Description": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm - CVE-2014-3566 Multiple implementations of SSL 3.0, including the implementation in OpenSSL up to version 1.0.1i, support the use of CBC mode. However, SSL 3.0 is vulnerable to a padding-oracle attack when CBC mode is used. A successful padding-oracle attack can provide an attacker with cleartext information from the encrypted communications. Additionally, many modern TLS clients still support the ability to fall back to the SSL 3.0 protocol in order to communicate with legacy servers. A man-in-the-middle attacker may be able to force the protocol version negotiation sequence to downgrade to SSL 3.0, thereby opening up the opportunity to exploit the padding-oracle attack. For more information, please refer to the original security advisory.", 
  "CVSS_AccessComplexity": "M", 
  "CVSS_SecurityRequirementsAR": "ND", 
  "Resolution": "OpenSSL has fixed the issue in OpenSSL versions 1.0.1j, 1.0.0o, and 0.9.8zc. For other implementations of the protocol, please check with the appropriate maintainer or vendor to determine if the implementation is affected by this issue. Additionally, consider the following workaround:",
