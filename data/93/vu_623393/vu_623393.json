  "Description": "A researcher named  Rub\u00e9n Santamarta posted information about the HMS HICP protocol. According to his research, the protocol is generally insecure (no encryption, no authentication). HICP is used to configure network settings for IntelliCom NetBiter and possibly other HMS Anybus-based devices. Parts of the post are reproduced here: HICP, is intented to configure HMS's products that include ethernet/ capabilities, since they need a method for configuring Internal IP,DCHP,NetworkMask,DNS,gateway. So we can see that in order to scan the network, this tool sends a broadcast UDP packet containing the string \"Module Scan\" to the HICP port (3250). Inside HMS-AnyBus based devices we can find a hicp daemon listening on port 3250. Once the device receives that packet it broadcasts a reply, which contains its current configuration, to the network on port 3250. The configure Tool listens on this port as well. Let's see what parameters can be configured via this protocol. Any value after the '=' can be modified. +\u201cProtocol version = 1.10; \u201d # Obvious\n+\u201dfb type = EVIL-DEVICE; \u201d # Device Type\n+\u201dmodule version = 0.66.6; +\u201dmac = 00-30-11-00-CA-FE; \u201d # MAC\n+\u201dip = 192.168.1.252; +\u201dsn = 255.255.255.0; \u201d # Network Mask\n+\u201dgw = 192.168.1.1; \u201d # Gateway\n+\u201ddhcp = off; \u201d # whether the device is using a DHCP server for obtaining the IP address. (on/off) +\u201dpswd = off; \u201d # whether the device is using a PASSWORD(on/off)\n+\u201dhn = morroBufalo; \u201d # hostname (optional)\n+\u201ddns1 = 192.168.1.33; \u201d # Primary DNS\n+\u201ddns2 = 192.168.1.34; \u201d # Secondary DNS (optional)\n+\u201dpassword = admin; \u201d # old password (if any, admin by default)\n+\u201dnew password = fatbird; \u201d # new password These parameters are sent via UDP in plain text, concatenating each one and separated by a \";\". If you want to configure a device, you need to prepend a \"Configure:\" string in this way: \"Configure: xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx;\"+ parameters_string. Where xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx is the MAC of the device you want to configure. You can take a look at HICP_SendConfigure code to verity it. This request is broadcasted so is received by any device/machine in the network listening on 3250/UDP. The device checks the MAC against it own and if matches then proceeds to update its internal registers.The first three bytes of the MAC are always 00-30-11 which correspond to the HMS' oui as expected. In addition to this request, there are a couple of additional replyes implemented: + \"Invalid Password:\" to indicate a failed configuration attempt \n+ \"Reconfigured:\" to indicate success. That's all. Make your own conclusions about the security level of this protocol.I'm just presenting facts. HICP is not significantly less secure than DHCP, with the exception of transmitting the HICP configuration password in plain text. The post also included information about two vulnerabilities in IntelliCom NetBiter webSCADA products: A buffer overflow in the HICP hostname (hn) field (VU#181737) in the NetBiter Config utility and default HICP passwords in NetBiter firmware (VU#902793). IntelliCom Innovation AB is partly owned by HMS Industrial Networks AB.",
