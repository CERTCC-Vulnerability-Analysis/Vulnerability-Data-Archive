  "Description": "1169007: Security: Root access possible on SunOS 4.1.x via forced passwd\nrace condition.\n\nThis patch restricts the use of the passwd command's -F option to root,\nunless the system administrator explicitly permits non-root users to\nuse the option for specifically-identified alternate password files.\n\nIf you wish to permit such use, set up a file called /etc/pwfiles\ncontaining a line for each full path you wish to allow non-root users\nto specify as an argument to the -F option.  Lines in /etc/pwfiles\nwhich do not begin with a \"/\" character are treated as comments; this\neffectively allows non-root users to use only fully-specified paths\nwith -F.  The use of the /etc/pwfiles file in this way is analogous to\nthe way the /etc/shells file is used by the passwd command to restrict\nthe shells non-root users can set up for themselves (you can see the\npasswd man page for more information on the /etc/shells file).\n\nUnauthorized non-root use of the -F flag produces the message:\n\npasswd: -F may not be specified for file <-F arg>.",
