  "Description": "Panda ActiveScan is an online scanner that is reported to detect malware, vulnerabilities, and unknown threats. Panda ActiveScan, which is available as an ActiveX control for Internet Explorer browsers and as an NSAPI plug-in for other browsers, includes an installer component (as2stubie.dll) for downloading and installing the remaining components of the ActiveScan product (as2guiie.cab). The Panda ActiveScan installer fails to validate the digital signature of downloaded components. The location of the components to download can also be specified by an attacker.", 
  "CVSS_AccessComplexity": "--", 
  "CVSS_SecurityRequirementsAR": "Not Defined (ND)", 
  "Resolution": "Apply an update\nThis vulnerability is addressed with as2stubie.dll version 1.3.3.0. This version of the stub installer verifies the digital signature of the downloaded components. This updated version can be obtained by revisiting the ActiveScan website and installing the updated components as prompted. This will replace the old, vulnerable installer component. The vulnerable ActiveX control is also disabled in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-008.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable the ActiveScan Installer ActiveX control in Internet Explorer The ActiveScan Installer ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID: {2D8ED06D-3C30-438B-96AE-4D110FDC1FB8} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{2D8ED06D-3C30-438B-96AE-4D110FDC1FB8}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{2D8ED06D-3C30-438B-96AE-4D110FDC1FB8}]\n\"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\nDisable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document.\u00a0 Disable plug-ins Disabling plug-ins by default can prevent exploitation of this and other plug-in vulnerabilities. This can be accomplished by configuring NoScript to Forbid other plugins for untrusted sites, as outlined in the Securing Your Web Browser document..",
