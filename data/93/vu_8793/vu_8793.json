  "Description": "I thought about what would happen if a forged syn was sent to two\naddresses, pointing them at each other.  So I tried it.  I flipped the\naddresses, and used 23 for both src and dst ports.  Guess what?  The\ntarget hosts went into a SYN,ACK war, each of them generating SYN,ACK\nin response to the invalid SYN,ACK (since the sequence number was\nwrong).  The machines I used were BSD/OS 2.1, but any BSD based system\nshould be at risk.",

  "Workarounds": "My gut reaction is to modify the code so that if a packet arrives with a SYN,ACK for an existing connection that is not yet established, and the sequence number is invalid, the inbound packet is silently dropped. The other option would be to generate an RST, however silent drop has the advantage that it defends against a bad-guy flooding with bogus SYN,ACKs in an attempt to prevent a specific host from connecting.",
