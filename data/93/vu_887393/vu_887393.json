  "Workarounds": "Workarounds If you cannot upgrade to Windows 2000 SP3, the following steps may help to limit your exposure: Disable the SNMP service on systems that do not require it. Change community names from their default values. 'public' is commonly used for the read-only community name and 'private' is commonly used for the read-write name. Permit SNMP queries from only authorized network managment stations using the 'Services' management snap-in. Filter queries from all other sources using a simple packet filter or an IPsec policy. In general, we recommend a conservative, minimalist approach to network configuration. Therefore, these steps are recommended even for systems running SP3.",
