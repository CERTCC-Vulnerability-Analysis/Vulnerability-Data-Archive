  "Description": "IntelliCom NetBiter products use the proprietary HICP protocol to configure ethernet and IP network settings. NetBiter devices ship with default, well-known HICP passwords. The password is not hard-coded (persistent) as described in the original post by Rub\u00e9n Santamarta. The password is set by default but can be changed.",
