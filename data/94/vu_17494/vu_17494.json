  "Description": "When processing newgroup and rmgroup control messages, the\nparsecontrol script calls the sh \"eval\" command on the name of the\nnewsgroup, without first checking whether the newsgroup name contains\ncharacters such as ` (backtick). This means that anyone able to send a\ncontrol message to your innd (e.g., anyone in the world who has Usenet\naccess) is most likely able to execute arbitrary commands on your news\nserver with the uid of the innd process. These commands would be\nexecuted before checking whether the sender is authorized to create or\nremove newsgroups, so any checking you have at that level (e.g.,\nrunning pgpverify) isn't relevant to preventing this problem.\n\nI think the problem can be fixed by checking the value of the\nparameter $1 before entering parsecontrol's while loop.\n\nSome of you (e.g., people who were on the \"inn-gurus\" list) received\ne-mail from me about this in July 1995. What I'm describing here is\nexactly the same problem. As far as I know, the problem, although\nwidely known at the time, was never fixed in any INN distribution.",
