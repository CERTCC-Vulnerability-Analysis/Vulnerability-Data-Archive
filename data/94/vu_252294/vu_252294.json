  "Description": "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') Mediatrix's web management interface for the 4402 digital gateway device with firmware version Dgw 1.1.13.186, and possibly earlier versions, contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The reflected XSS is found in the login page's vulnerable parameter \"username\". The following is a proof-of-concept of the XSS vulnerability. http://<<MediatrixWebInterfaceIP/Host>>/login.esp?r=system_info.esp&username=%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E",
