  "Description": "According to ISC: DNS systems use negative caching to improve DNS response time. This will keep a DNS resolver from repeatedly looking up domains that do not exist. Any NXDOMAIN or NODATA/NOERROR response will be put into the negative cache. The authority data will be cached along with the negative cache information. These authoritative \u201cStart of Authority\u201d (SOA) and NSEC/NSEC3 records prove the nonexistence of the requested name/type. In DNSSEC, all of these records are signed; this adds one additional RRSIG record, per DNSSEC key, for each record returned in the authority section of the response. In this vulnerability, very large RRSIG RRsets included in a negative response can trigger an assertion failure that will crash named (BIND 9 DNS) due to an off-by-one error in a buffer size check. The nature of this vulnerability would allow remote exploit. An attacker can set up a DNSSEC signed authoritative DNS server with large RRSIG RRsets to act as the trigger. The attacker would then find ways to query an organization\u2019s caching resolvers for non-existent names in the domain served by the bad server, getting a response that would \u201ctrigger\u201d the vulnerability. The attacker would require access to an organization\u2019s caching resolvers; access to the resolvers can be direct (open resolvers), through malware (using a BOTNET to query negative caches), or through driving DNS resolution (a SPAM run that has a domain in the E-mail that will cause the client to perform a lookup).",

  "Resolution": "Apply an update Users who obtain BIND from a third-party vendor, such as their operating system vendor, should see the vendor information portion of this document for a partial list of affected vendors. This vulnerability is addressed in ISC BIND versions 9.4-ESV-R4-P1, 9.6-ESV-R4-P1, 9.7.3-P1 and 9.8.0-P2. Users of BIND from the original source distribution should upgrade to this version.
