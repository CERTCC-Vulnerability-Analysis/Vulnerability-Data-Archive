  "Description": "Dahua Technologies Co., Ltd. produces DVR appliances that contain multiple vulnerabilities. CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials - CVE-2013-3612\nAll DVRs of the same series ship with the same default root password on a read-only partition. Therefore, the root password can only be changed by flashing the firmware. Additionally, a separate hard-coded remote backdoor account exists that can be used to control cameras and other system components remotely. It is only accessible if authorization is done through ActiveX or the stand-alone client. Additionally, a hash of the current date can be used as a master password to gain access to the system and reset the administrator's password. CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-reply - CVE-2013-3613\nThe DVR appliance accepts UPnP requests from external untrusted devices. This can cause the telnet port of a DVR appliance to be automatically forwarded and accessible by external parties. These default conditions could allow an external attacker to detect the device and authenticate using the hard-coded credentials. CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements - CVE-2013-3614\nThe device enforces insufficient password requirements. User passwords are limited to only six characters in length, making them computationally feasible to discover using brute-force methods. CWE-916: Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort - CVE-2013-3615\nUser passwords are hashed with a weak 48-bit algorithm, and are therefore susceptible to brute-force attacks within a reasonable amount of time. The CVSS score reflects CVE-2013-3612. Dahua has disputed some of these vulnerabilities. Please see Dahua's vendor information for details.",
