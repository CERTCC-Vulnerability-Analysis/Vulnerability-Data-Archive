  "Description": "Due to insufficient bounds checking on arguments which are supplied\nby users, it is possible to overwrite the internal stack space of the\npasswd program while it is executing.  This can allow an intruder to\ncause passwd to execute arbitrary commands by supplying a carefully\ndesigned argument to passwd.  These commands will be run with the\nprivileges of the passwd program.  As passwd is setuid root it may\nallow intruders to run arbitrary commands with root privileges.",
