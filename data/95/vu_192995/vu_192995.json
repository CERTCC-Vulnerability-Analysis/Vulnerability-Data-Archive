  "Impact": "Because SunRPC-derived XDR libraries are used by a variety of vendors in a variety of applications, this defect may lead to a number of differing security problems. Exploiting this vulnerability will lead to denial of service, execution of arbitrary code, or the disclosure of sensitive information. Specific impacts reported include the ability to execute arbitrary code with root privileges (by exploiting dmispd, rpc.cmsd, or kadmind, for example). In addition, intruders who exploit the XDR overflow in MIT KRB5 kadmind may be able to gain control of a Key Distribution Center (KDC) and improperly authenticate to other services within a trusted Kerberos realm.",

  "Resolution": "Apply a patch from your vendor Note that XDR libraries can be used by multiple applications on most systems. It may be necessary to upgrade or apply multiple patches and then recompile statically linked applications. Applications that are statically linked must be recompiled using patched libraries. Applications that are dynamically linked do not need to be recompiled; however, running services need to be restarted in order to use the patched libraries. System administrators should consider the following process when addressing this issue: Patch or obtain updated XDR/RPC libraries. Restart any dynamically linked services that make use of the XDR/RPC libraries. Recompile any statically linked applications using the patched or updated XDR/RPC libraries. Note this is an iterative process for each set of patches being applied.",

  "Overview": "There is an integer overflow present in the xdr_array() function distributed as part of the Sun Microsystems XDR library. This overflow has been shown to lead to remotely exploitable buffer overflows in multiple applications, leading to the execution of arbitrary code. Although the library was originally distributed by Sun Microsystems, multiple vendors have included the vulnerable code in their own implementations.",
