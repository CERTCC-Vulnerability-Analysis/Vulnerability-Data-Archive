CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) CVE-2012-2447: (2) The Netsweeper Internet Filter WebAdmin Portal is vulnerable to CSRF using the HTTP POST method in the /webadmin/accountmgr/adminupdate.php?act=add function. The CSRF reported allows for a breach in the content filtering system resulting in complete compromise of an organizations Internet content filter and control over users internet traffic. CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') CVE-2012-3859\n(3) The Netsweeper Internet Filter WebAdmin Portal is vulnerable to SQL injection, in the sortorder and sortitem variables. An example of a vulnerable url is http://SERVER_Hostname/webadmin/reporter/view_details.php?sortitem=report_date&sortorder=asc&type=demand&id=1441.",
