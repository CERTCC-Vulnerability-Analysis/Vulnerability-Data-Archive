  "Impact": "Malicious users can post to phpBB bulletin boards and include active script code. For many users the active script code will be executed by their browsers, due to active content being enabled by default in many popular browsers. Note that proof of concept code has been made public. There are also reports of the vulnerability being exploited in order to capture site administrator authentication details, which are then used to perform further attacks unrelated to the phpBB flaw.",

For more information on the patch please see: http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=288194 Code has been added to the includes/bbcode.php to blacklist certain active script tags, as an attempt to address this vulnerability. In general blacklisting is not an effective counter measure to malicious user input, due to the fact that characters can be encoded in many ways. As a best practice, users of bulletin board sites and other sites where content is created from untrusted sources, such as the public, should consider turning off all forms of scripting support in their browsers. More information about injecting code into forums is available in the CERT/CC advisory CA-2000-02.",
