This version of the CD DVD Filter driver limits the number of IoAttachDevice calls that can be made. Please check with your software vendor for updates that contains this fixed driver. If no update is available, the stand-alone driver from GEAR may be installed. Apple iTunes users should install iTunes 8.0, as specified in the About the security content of iTunes 8.0 document. Symantec customers using Norton 360, Norton Ghost, Norton Save and Restore, Backup Exec System Recovery, and Symantec LiveState Recovery should apply an update, as specified in the Symantec Security Advisory SYM08-017.",
