  "Description": "Comodo Chromodo is a web browser that comes packaged with Comodo Internet Security. It is based on Chromium 45.0.2454.93, which was released in September 2015. By default, the browser uses the Ad Sanitizer extension by AdtrustMedia, which disables same origin protections and allows for an attacker to access a victim user's web content from other domains via a specially crafted web page. According to the original disclosure by the Project Zero team at Google, version 45.8.12.392 was released to address attacks based on the use of execCode. Version 45.8.12.392 appears to remove Ad Sanitizer.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable or remove Ad Sanitizer Disabling or removing the Ad Sanitizer extension mitigates cross-domain attacks. This can be accomplished by updating to version 45.8.12.392 or through the extensions management interface. For instructions, refer to the Chromodo help page. Note that disabling Ad Sanitizer does not address known vulnerabilities in the version of Chromium on which Chromodo is based. For this reason, users should prioritize implementing the following workaround. Discontinue use Until these issues are addressed, consider discontinuing use of Chromodo.",

  "Overview": "Comodo Chromodo browser, version 45.8.12.391, and possibly earlier, bundles the Ad Sanitizer extension, version 1.4.0.26, which disables the same origin policy, allowing for the possibility of cross-domain attacks by malicious or compromised web hosts. Chromodo is based on an outdated release of Chromium with known vulnerabilities.",
