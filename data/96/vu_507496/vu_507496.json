  "Description": "CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure - CVE-2017-3197 GIGABYTE UEFI firmware for the GB-BSi7H-6500 and GB-BXi7-5775 platforms fails to properly set the BIOSWE, BLE, SMM_BWP, and PRx bits. As a result, the BIOS is not protected from arbitrary write access and may permit modifications to the SPI flash. CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity - CVE-2017-3198 GIGABYTE UEFI firmware for the GB-BSi7H-6500 and GB-BXi7-5775 platforms is not cryptographically signed and is served over HTTP from the vendor's support pages without a checksum. An attacker in the position to do so may introduce arbitrary modifications to the firmware that the system has no means to detect. Note that the affected GIGABYTE firmware is a vulnerable implementation of an AMI reference design that does not, by default, appear to be affected by these issues. For more information about these findings, refer to the Cylance advisory, CLVA-2017-01-002.",

  "Overview": "GIGABYTE BRIX UEFI firmware for the GB-BSi7H-6500 and GB-BXi7-5775 platforms, versions vF6 and vF2 respectively, fails to properly set the BIOSWE, BLE, SMM_BWP, and PRx bits to enforce write protection. It also is not cryptographically signed. These issues may permit an attacker to write arbitrary code to the platform firmware, potentially allowing for persistent firmware level rootkits or the creation of a permanent denial of service condition in the platform.",
