  "Description": "Attachments in MS outlook are identified as an icon with a filename underneath, in a typical windows fashion. An intruder can construct a filename that may mislead users into executing unwanted programs. Specifically, if the filename is something of the form \n\n              \"a.doc                                                            .exe\"\n\nwhere there are enough spaces to cause outlook to show the real extension as an elipsis (...), then users might think this file is Microsoft Word file, and execute it. \n\n",
