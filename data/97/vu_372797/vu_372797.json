  "Resolution": "Upgrade \nVersion 6.0.2 corrects this vulnerability. According to ESi: Specific validation checks have been added to all input fields that appeared to be susceptible to SQL injection or cross-site scripting attacks to protect input fields against SQL injection or XSS attempts. In addition, all function parameters are validated in the application business logic. The validation process replaces ' with '' for String parameters, and for numeric parameters it verifies that the parameter is numeric. Such checks are a good first line of defense against SQL injection attacks. To obtain WebEOC upgrades, contact ESi Technical Support.",
