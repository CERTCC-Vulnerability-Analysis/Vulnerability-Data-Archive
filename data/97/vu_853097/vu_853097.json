  "Description": "NTP (Network Time Protocol) is a method by which client machines can synchronize the local date and time with a reference server. ntpd, which is the NTP daemon, contains a stack buffer overflow when it is compiled with OpenSSL support. The vulnerability is caused by the use of sprintf() in the crypto_recv() function in ntpd/ntp_crypto.c. The vulnerable code is reachable if ntpd is configured to use autokey. This vulnerable configuration is indicated by a crypto pw password line in the ntp.conf file, where password is the password that has been configured.",
