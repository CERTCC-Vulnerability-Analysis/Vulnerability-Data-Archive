  "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the KDC host, potentially compromising an entire Kerberos realm. An unsuccessful attack against this heap corruption vulnerability may result in a denial of service by crashing the KDC process. According to the MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2005-002, this vulnerability affects the KDC implementation in all MIT krb5 releases supporting TCP client connections to the KDC. This includes krb5-1.3 and later releases, up to and including krb5-1.4.1.",
