  "Description": "We have found that several of the CDE programs have buffer overflow\nvulnerabilities.  These are in addition to the buffer overflows\nalready reported in the X11/Xt libraries.  The vulnerable programs\nthe we have found are:\n\n/usr/dt/bin/dtaction\n/usr/dt/bin/dtmail\n/usr/dt/bin/dtmailpr\n/usr/dt/bin/dtprintinfo\n/usr/dt/bin/dtsession\n\nThe routines that introduce the vulnerabilities seem to be in\nlibDtSvc.  For example, in ActionUtil.c:\n\nchar dirBuf[MAXPATHLEN];\n...\nstrcpy(dirBuf,getenv(\"HOME\"));\n\nThere are probably may other environment variables that show the\nproblem.  HOME just happens to be one of them.",
