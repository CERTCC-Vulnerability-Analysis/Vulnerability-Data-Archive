  "Description": "CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write - CVE-2016-5637 According to the reporter, improper checking of transquant_bypass_enable_flag in the function restore_tqb_pixels in libbpg 0.9.5 through 0.9.7 may allow a crafted file to write out-of-bounds, which may lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution. Other versions may also be impacted. The CERT/CC has not been able to confirm this information with libbpg developers. libbpg is used within other products; see the Vendor Status list below for more information.",

  "CVSS_SecurityRequirementsAR": "ND", 
  "Resolution": "The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Users may consider the following workarounds: Update ImageMagick Security Policy ImageMagick's security policy may be updated to deny BPG from use by modifying the policy.xml configuration file. The BPG element may also be removed from the delegate.xml configuration file. More information on these configuration files is available at ImageMagick's website.",
