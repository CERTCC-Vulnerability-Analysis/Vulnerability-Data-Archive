  "Description": "In a previous bug report (Customer bug number: 13) I reported that\ninteger division can be used to gain root access.  At the time I was\npuzzled why the same was not true for integer multiplication, since\nthe code appears very similar.  In a recent discussion concerning the\ndivision bug Guy Harris of Auspex pointed out to me that the\nmultiplication code has a special \"fast path\" that is used when a free\nregister window is available in which temporary results can be\ncomputed.  A bit of testing has shown me that if no free register\nwindow is available integer multiplication also constitutes a security\nhole.\n\nOnce again you probably already know about this bug, although again\nperhaps not the consequences.  (In August of last year Blake Lewis of\nSun mentioned to me how an almost identical piece of code was known to\ncrash a Sun 4 as part of a discussion we had concerning an earlier\nversion of the \"crashme\" program).",
