  "Description": "CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2017-3187 \nThe dotCMS administrator panel contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request. CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') - CVE-2017-3188 \nWhen \"Bundle\" tar.gz archives uploaded to the Push Publishing feature are decompressed, the filenames of its contents are not properly checked, allowing for writing files to arbitrary directories on the file system. These archives may be uploaded directly via the administrator panel, or using the CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2017-3187) described above. CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type - CVE-2017-3189\nWhen \"Bundle\" tar.gz archives uploaded to the Push Publishing feature are decompressed, there are no checks on the types of files which the bundle contains. This vulnerability combined with the path traversal vulnerability above (CVE-2017-3188) can lead to remote command execution with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application.",
