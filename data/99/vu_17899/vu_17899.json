  "Description": "Microsoft IE v4.0 does not properly handle addresses in the form of http://3475932041.  It seems that IE assumes that since there is not a period in the address it is treated as part of the local intranet zone.  This could make a user think a site was part of their local intranet when really the site is not trusted.  This does not affect IE3 or IE4 for Macintosh.  A patch is available to fix this problem.",
