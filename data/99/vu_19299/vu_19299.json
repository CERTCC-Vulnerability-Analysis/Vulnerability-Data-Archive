  "Description": "Create a soft link from anyone's mailbox on the system to a file\n        in /tmp called dtmail.dump.  If dtmail gets confused (like\n        he might if multiple mailers get invoked), he can and will \n        write a file called dtmail.dump. It will write all over the\n        user's mailbox.   The beauty of this is\n        that *anyone* can set up the link as a trap, and just\n        wait for it to happen.",
