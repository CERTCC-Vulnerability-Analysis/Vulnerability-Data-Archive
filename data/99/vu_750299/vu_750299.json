It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) may be able to filter requests made to the Apache service. Note that these workarounds are designed to limit access and detect exploit attempts. These workarounds do not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.

  "Overview": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Apache Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). A maliciously crafted HTTP request made to the PL/SQL module could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Apache service.",
